// The /tour public page reads this. The future in-studio popup walkthrough
// (D45 follow-up) will read the same file so the two never drift.
//
// Scope per user direction: the tour mirrors the studio tab walkthrough —
// sign-in is not part of the studio, and the save-the-run + open-history
// flows live inside the run-history surface (not on a studio tab), so they
// are intentionally omitted from this tour.
