  'The catalog is anchored on the four "Gang of Four" patterns first codified by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides in 1994. Their book named the recurring object-oriented arrangements that working engineers kept reinventing - Singleton, Factory, Adapter, Strategy and the rest - and gave each shape a vocabulary item that survives across languages. Nesteruk 2022 modernises those same patterns for C++20 (smart pointers, deduction, ranges) without changing what the patterns are. We anchor on GoF because the names are the lingua franca every reviewer already knows, and because the structural fingerprints (virtual interfaces, ownership handles, self-returning setters) translate cleanly into the token-level checks our analyser runs. A handful of non-GoF entries (Method Chaining, Repository, PIMPL) sit alongside them because the CodiNeo thesis explicitly lists them as detection targets.';
