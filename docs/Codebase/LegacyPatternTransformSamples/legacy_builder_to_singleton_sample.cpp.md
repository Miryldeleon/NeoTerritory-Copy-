# legacy_builder_to_singleton_sample.cpp

- Source: LegacyPatternTransformSamples/legacy_builder_to_singleton_sample.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This file implements a legacy pattern-transform scenario rather than part of the current runtime engine. Its code is kept to document the older design-pattern-changing system while the active analyzer focuses on tagging evidence.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

These files document the older design-pattern transformation corpus rather than the current tagging-first runtime.

### What To Watch While Reading

Provides legacy sample source programs from the older pattern-to-pattern transform system. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as Query, QueryBuilder, set_name, and set_limit. It collaborates directly with string.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Provides legacy sample source programs from the older pattern-to-pattern transform system.

Where it sits in the run: These files document the older design-pattern transformation corpus rather than the current tagging-first runtime.

Names worth recognizing while reading: Query, QueryBuilder, set_name, set_limit, build, and main.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as string.

## Story Groups

### Building The Working Picture
These steps assemble the trees, models, or bundles used by the rest of the file.
- build(): Create the local output structure and fill local output fields

### Supporting Steps
These steps support the local behavior of the file.
- set_name(): Owns a focused local responsibility.
- set_limit(): Owns a focused local responsibility.
- main(): Owns a focused local responsibility.

## Function Stories

### set_name()
This routine owns one focused piece of the file's behavior.

What it does:
- This routine is primarily structural and does not expose obvious runtime operations from static inspection.

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["set_name()"]
    N0["Set name"]
    N1["Execute file-local step"]
    N2["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> End
```

### set_limit()
This routine owns one focused piece of the file's behavior.

What it does:
- This routine is primarily structural and does not expose obvious runtime operations from static inspection.

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["set_limit()"]
    N0["Set limit"]
    N1["Execute file-local step"]
    N2["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> End
```

### build()
This routine assembles a larger structure from the inputs it receives.

Inside the body, it mainly handles Create the local output structure and fill local output fields.

The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- Create the local output structure
- fill local output fields

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["build()"]
    N0["Handle build"]
    N1["Create local result"]
    N2["Populate outputs"]
    N3["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### main()
This routine owns one focused piece of the file's behavior.

The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- This routine is primarily structural and does not expose obvious runtime operations from static inspection.

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["main()"]
    N0["Handle main"]
    N1["Execute file-local step"]
    N2["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> End
```
