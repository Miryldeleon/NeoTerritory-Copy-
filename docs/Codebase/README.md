# Codebase Mirror

- Folder: docs/Codebase
- Descendant source docs: 151
- Generated on: 2026-04-23

## Logic Summary
Top-level logical view of the generated codebase mirror. It groups the repository into the frontend live-analysis surface, backend service code, infrastructure automation, legacy transform samples, repository hygiene, and the C++ microservice core.

## Blueprint Boundary
This `docs/Codebase` tree is the implementation mirror. Folders and Markdown files here should map to current or planned code folders/files.

Granular Mermaid details stay inside the Markdown file they describe. Do not create documentation-only detail folders inside this mirror.

Every normal folder in this tree should be safe to treat as a current or planned implementation folder.

## Subsystem Story
This folder should mostly route readers into subsystem folders. Microservice-only build and editor artifacts belong under `Microservice/`, not beside Backend, Frontend, and Infrastructure.

## Child Folders By Logic
### Backend Service
These child folders continue the subsystem by covering Backend service surface for live class analysis, AI documentation, structured logs, and HTTP runtime internals under src.
- Backend/ : Backend service surface for live class analysis, AI documentation, and HTTP runtime internals.

### Frontend Prototype
These child folders continue the subsystem by covering Frontend prototype shell. This area groups the browser entrypoint with route fragments, scripts, styles, and the class-boundary trigger.
- Frontend/ : Frontend prototype shell for live class-boundary analysis and rendered results.

### Microservice Core
These child folders continue the subsystem by covering C++ executable and module tree that implement the parser, detector, documentation tagging, rendering, and report pipeline.
- Microservice/ : C++ executable and module tree that implement the parser, detector, documentation tagging, rendering, and report pipeline.

### Legacy Transform Samples
These child folders continue the subsystem by covering Legacy pattern-to-pattern transform examples kept for historical comparison with the current tagging-first system.
- LegacyPatternTransformSamples/ : Legacy pattern-to-pattern transform examples kept for historical comparison with the current tagging-first system.

### Infrastructure Automation
These child folders continue the subsystem by covering Infrastructure automation and runtime environment assembly for local containerized execution.
- Infrastructure/ : Infrastructure automation and runtime environment assembly for local containerized execution.

## Documents By Logic
### Root Entry Scripts
The repo collapses all root scripts into a single cross-platform dispatcher. Subcommands: `dev` (default), `setup`, `k8s`, `browser`, `test`. Universal flags include `-Lan` / `--lan` for LAN exposure. See DESIGN_DECISIONS.md (D28).
- start.ps1.md : Windows entry — dispatches dev / setup / k8s / browser / test.
- start.sh.md  : POSIX entry — same subcommand surface as start.ps1.

### Project Notes
These documents explain the local implementation by covering Keeps loose repository-level notes outside the formal docs set.
- Notes.md : Keeps loose repository-level notes outside the formal docs set.

### Repository Hygiene
These documents explain which generated or machine-local artifacts must stay out of Git before normal pushes or force-push cleanups.
- .gitignore.md : Keeps dependency caches, build output, generated frontend bundles, runtime logs, and local editor state out of version control.

## Reading Hint
- Start with the subsystem folder that owns the concern. Use `Microservice/` for C++ build, executable, module, and validation docs.
