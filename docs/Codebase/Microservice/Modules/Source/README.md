# Source

- Folder: `docs/Codebase/Microservice/Modules/Source`
- Role: source-side navigation map for the flattened analysis subsystem

## Primary Entry
- Start with [core.cpp.md](./core.cpp.md).

## Read By Goal
- Whole subsystem: `core.cpp.md`
- Structural and pattern analysis: `Analysis/`
- Rooted tree ownership and class generation: `Trees/`
- Cascading identity and lookup: `HashingMechanism/`
- Interval auto-checking and partial subtree regeneration: `Diffing/`
- Unit-test generation, tagging, reports, and render output: `OutputGeneration/`

## Boundary
- `README.md` is for folder navigation.
- `core.cpp.md` is the real subsystem start file.
- Stage folders own their local entrypoints and helper guides.
- The only executable `main.cpp` document is `docs/Codebase/Microservice/main.cpp.md`.

## Acceptance Checks
- a reader can start from `core.cpp.md` without opening a wrapper folder first
- `README.md` guides navigation instead of duplicating the subsystem intro
- stage folders remain the main ownership boundaries
- the source subsystem no longer presents a second `main.cpp.md` beside the executable entrypoint
