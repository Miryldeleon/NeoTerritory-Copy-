## Documents By Logic
### Syntactic Pipeline
These documents explain the local implementation by covering Normalizes runtime arguments before source loading and catalog-driven pattern recognition begins. and Loads discovered source files into SourceFileUnit records and optional monolithic views.
- cli_arguments.cpp.md : Normalizes runtime arguments before source loading and catalog-driven pattern recognition begins.
- source_reader.cpp.md : Loads discovered source files into SourceFileUnit records and optional monolithic views.

## Reading Hint
- This folder is mostly leaf-level. Read the local file docs to understand the logic in this area.
