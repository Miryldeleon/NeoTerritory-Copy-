- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file belongs to the older creational transform support path. It is useful for understanding previous rewrite behavior, but the current analyzer runtime focuses on tagging evidence instead of generating replacement code. This source file implements creational-pattern analysis against completed class-declaration subtrees. It inspects parsed structure, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits detector results that later appear in the creational tree or documentation tags.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as SingletonCallsiteEvidence, EvidenceScanResult, MonolithicClassView, and collect_class_signature_lines. It collaborates directly with Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp, sstream, string, and vector.

## Program Flow
Detailed program flow is decoupled into future implementation units:

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: SingletonCallsiteEvidence, EvidenceScanResult, MonolithicClassView, collect_class_signature_lines, collect_method_signature_lines, and brace_delta.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp, sstream, string, and vector.
