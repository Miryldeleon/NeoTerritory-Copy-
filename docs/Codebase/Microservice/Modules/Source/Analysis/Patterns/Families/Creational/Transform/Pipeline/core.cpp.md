# creational_transform_pipeline.cpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Creational/Transform/creational_transform_pipeline.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file belongs to the older creational transform support path. It is useful for understanding previous rewrite behavior, but the current analyzer runtime focuses on tagging evidence instead of generating replacement code. This source file implements creational-pattern analysis against completed class-declaration subtrees. It inspects parsed structure, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits detector results that later appear in the creational tree or documentation tags.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as run_creational_transform_pipeline, render_creational_evidence_view, and creational_codegen_internal::build_monolithic_evidence_view. It collaborates directly with Transform/creational_transform_pipeline.hpp and Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of creational_transform_pipeline.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for creational_transform_pipeline.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: creational_transform_pipeline.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for creational_transform_pipeline.cpp after setup.
Why this is separate: creational_transform_pipeline.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: run_creational_transform_pipeline, render_creational_evidence_view, and creational_codegen_internal::build_monolithic_evidence_view.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as Transform/creational_transform_pipeline.hpp and Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp.

## Story Groups

### Building The Working Picture
These steps assemble the trees, models, or bundles used by the rest of the file.
- render_creational_evidence_view(): Render or serialize the result and connect local structures

### Main Path
These steps drive the main execution path by calling the supporting work in order.
- run_creational_transform_pipeline(): Drive the main execution path and work one source line at a time

## Function Stories

### run_creational_transform_pipeline()
This routine prepares or drives one of the main execution paths in the file.

Inside the body, it mainly handles drive the main execution path and work one source line at a time.

The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- drive the main execution path
- work one source line at a time

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["run_creational_transform_pipeline()"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
    N1["Drive path"]
    N2["Read lines"]
    L2{"More items?"}
    N3["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> L2
    L2 -->|more| N2
    L2 -->|done| N3
    N3 --> End
```

### render_creational_evidence_view()
This routine materializes internal state into an output format that later stages can consume.

Inside the body, it mainly handles render or serialize the result and connect local structures.

The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- render or serialize the result
- connect local structures

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["render_creational_evidence_view()"]
    N0["Render creational evidence view"]
    N1["Render output"]
    N2["Connect local nodes"]
    N3["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```
