## Logic Summary
Builder-pattern specific detection logic.

## Subsystem Story
This folder is mostly leaf-level. The local documents here carry the main explanation of the subsystem without requiring much extra descent.

## Pattern Hook Role
Builder logic should act as a pattern-specific hook, not as the owner of tree assembly. The shared creational middleman should register classes, prepare common context, and attach output nodes. Builder-specific code should only decide whether a registered class has builder evidence.

## Documents By Logic
### Creational Detection
These documents explain the local implementation by covering Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees.
- builder_pattern_logic.cpp.md : Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees.

## Reading Hint
- This folder is mostly leaf-level. Read the local file docs to understand the logic in this area.
