# creational_transform_factory_reverse_parse.cpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Creational/Transform/creational_transform_factory_reverse_parse.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file belongs to the older creational transform support path. It is useful for understanding previous rewrite behavior, but the current analyzer runtime focuses on tagging evidence instead of generating replacement code. This source file implements creational-pattern analysis against completed class-declaration subtrees. It inspects parsed structure, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits detector results that later appear in the creational tree or documentation tags.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as parse_create_mapping_from_class_body, collect_factory_classes, and class_regex. It collaborates directly with internal/creational_transform_factory_reverse_internal.hpp, Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp, cctype, and regex.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of creational_transform_factory_reverse_parse.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for creational_transform_factory_reverse_parse.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: creational_transform_factory_reverse_parse.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: parse_create_mapping_from_class_body, collect_factory_classes, and class_regex.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as internal/creational_transform_factory_reverse_internal.hpp, Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp, cctype, regex, string, and vector.

## Story Groups

### Reading The Input
These steps turn raw text or arguments into something the program can follow.
- parse_create_mapping_from_class_body(): Parse source text into structured values and inspect or register class-level information

### Finding What Matters
These steps pick out the facts, traces, and relationships that later stages need.
- collect_factory_classes(): Collect derived facts for later stages, handle factory-specific detection or rewrite logic, and inspect or register class-level information

## Function Stories

### parse_create_mapping_from_class_body()
This routine ingests source content and turns it into a more useful structured form.

Inside the body, it mainly handles parse source text into structured values and inspect or register class-level information.

What it does:
- parse source text into structured values
- inspect or register class-level information

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["parse_create_mapping_from_class_body()"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
    N1["Parse text"]
    N2["Register classes"]
    N3["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### collect_factory_classes()
This routine connects discovered items back into the broader model owned by the file.

Inside the body, it mainly handles collect derived facts for later stages, handle factory-specific detection or rewrite logic, inspect or register class-level information, and match source text with regular expressions.

The implementation iterates over a collection or repeated workload. It branches on runtime conditions instead of following one fixed path. The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- collect derived facts for later stages
- handle factory-specific detection or rewrite logic
- inspect or register class-level information
- match source text with regular expressions
- look up local indexes
- store local findings
- normalize raw text before later parsing
- fill local output fields
- read local tokens
- connect local structures
- walk the local collection
- branch on local conditions
