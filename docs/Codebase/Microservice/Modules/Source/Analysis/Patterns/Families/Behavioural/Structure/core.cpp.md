# behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Behavioural/Logic/behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file implements behavioural-pattern scaffolding or checks against completed class-declaration subtrees. It contributes one part of the behavioural broken-tree output by scanning for behavioural structure signals.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so behavioural scaffolds can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements behavioural detection and structural verification scaffolds. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as lower_ascii and resolve_behavioural_structural_keywords. It collaborates directly with Logic/behavioural_structural_hooks.hpp, cctype, string, and vector.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp after setup.
Why this is separate: behavioural_structural_hooks.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements behavioural detection and structural verification scaffolds.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so behavioural scaffolds can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: lower_ascii and resolve_behavioural_structural_keywords.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as Logic/behavioural_structural_hooks.hpp, cctype, string, and vector.

## Story Groups

### Finding What Matters
These steps pick out the facts, traces, and relationships that later stages need.
- resolve_behavioural_structural_keywords(): Connect discovered data back into the shared model, fill local output fields, and branch on local conditions

### Supporting Steps
These steps support the local behavior of the file.
- lower_ascii(): Normalize raw text before later parsing and walk the local collection

## Function Stories

### lower_ascii()
This routine owns one focused piece of the file's behavior.

Inside the body, it mainly handles normalize raw text before later parsing and walk the local collection.

The implementation iterates over a collection or repeated workload. The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- normalize raw text before later parsing
- walk the local collection

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["lower_ascii()"]
    N0["Handle lower ascii"]
    N1["Clean text"]
    N2["Loop collection"]
    L2{"More items?"}
    N3["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> L2
    L2 -->|more| N2
    L2 -->|done| N3
    N3 --> End
```

### resolve_behavioural_structural_keywords()
This routine connects discovered items back into the broader model owned by the file.

Inside the body, it mainly handles connect discovered data back into the shared model, fill local output fields, and branch on local conditions.

It branches on runtime conditions instead of following one fixed path. The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- connect discovered data back into the shared model
- fill local output fields
- branch on local conditions

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["resolve_behavioural_structural_keywords()"]
    N0["Resolve behavioural structural keywords"]
    N1["Connect data"]
    N2["Populate outputs"]
    N3["Check local condition"]
    D3{"Continue?"}
    R3["Return early path"]
    N4["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> D3
    D3 -->|yes| N4
    D3 -->|no| R3
    R3 --> End
    N4 --> End
```
