# lower.cpp

- Source document: [builder_pattern_logic.cpp.md](../../core.cpp.md)
- Purpose: decoupled implementation logic for a future code unit.

### lower()
This routine owns one focused piece of the file's behavior.

The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- This routine is primarily structural and does not expose obvious runtime operations from static inspection.

Flow:

    N1["Execute file-local step"]
    N2["Return local result"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> End
```
