# creational_logic_scaffold.cpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Creational/Logic/creational_logic_scaffold.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file implements creational-pattern analysis against completed class-declaration subtrees. It inspects parsed structure, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits detector results that later appear in the creational tree or documentation tags.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as build_creational_class_scaffold. It collaborates directly with Logic/creational_logic_scaffold.hpp, parse_tree_dependency_utils.hpp, string, and utility.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of creational_logic_scaffold.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for creational_logic_scaffold.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: creational_logic_scaffold.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: build_creational_class_scaffold.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as Logic/creational_logic_scaffold.hpp, parse_tree_dependency_utils.hpp, string, and utility.

## Story Groups

### Building The Working Picture
These steps assemble the trees, models, or bundles used by the rest of the file.
- build_creational_class_scaffold(): Create the local output structure, inspect or register class-level information, and store local findings

## Function Stories

### build_creational_class_scaffold()
This routine assembles a larger structure from the inputs it receives.

Inside the body, it mainly handles Create the local output structure, inspect or register class-level information, store local findings, and read local tokens.

The implementation iterates over a collection or repeated workload. The caller receives a computed result or status from this step.

What it does:
- Create the local output structure
- inspect or register class-level information
- store local findings
- read local tokens
- connect local structures
- compute hash metadata
- walk the local collection
