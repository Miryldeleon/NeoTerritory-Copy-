# creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp

- Source document: [creational_code_generator_internal.cpp.md](../core.cpp.md)
- Purpose: decoupled implementation logic for a future code unit.

This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 3 - Hand Off Local State
Quick summary: This slice shows how creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp passes prepared local state into its next operation.
Why this is separate: creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 4 - Resolve Secondary Branch
Quick summary: This slice shows the next local decision path in creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp and its immediate result.
Why this is separate: creational_code_generator_internal_program_flow_01.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.
