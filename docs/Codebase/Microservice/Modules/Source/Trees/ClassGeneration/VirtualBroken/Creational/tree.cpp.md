# creational_broken_tree.cpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Creational/creational_broken_tree.cpp
- Kind: C++ implementation

## Story
### What Happens Here

This source file implements creational-pattern analysis against completed class-declaration subtrees. It inspects a specific actual class subtree, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits virtual-broken evidence that later appears in the creational tree or documentation tags.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

### What To Watch While Reading

Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as FactoryPatternDetector, SingletonPatternDetector, BuilderPatternDetector, and DefaultCreationalTreeCreator. It collaborates directly with creational_broken_tree.hpp, Builder/builder_pattern_logic.hpp, Factory/factory_pattern_logic.hpp, and Singleton/singleton_pattern_logic.hpp.

## Required Middleman Flow
The desired design is that this file behaves as the creational middleman for tree assembly. Individual pattern files should not own the repeated work of class registration, shared context setup, family-root assembly, or result attachment. They should expose only pattern-specific algorithms through virtual hooks or function-pointer style dispatch.


### Block 1 - Required Middleman Flow Details
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for creational_broken_tree.cpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: creational_broken_tree.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for creational_broken_tree.cpp after setup.
Why this is separate: creational_broken_tree.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Responsibility Split
- Middleman: class registration, shared symbol tables, traversal order, tree root, child attachment, empty output.
- Pattern hook: Factory return checks, Singleton accessor checks, Builder chain checks.
- Extension point: add a new hook without copying the assembly loop.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Implements creational pattern detection against completed class-declaration subtrees.

Where it sits in the run: Runs after a specific class-declaration subtree exists so creational detection can evaluate that completed class.

Names worth recognizing while reading: FactoryPatternDetector, SingletonPatternDetector, BuilderPatternDetector, DefaultCreationalTreeCreator, detect, and build_factory_pattern_tree.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as creational_broken_tree.hpp, Builder/builder_pattern_logic.hpp, Factory/factory_pattern_logic.hpp, Singleton/singleton_pattern_logic.hpp, Output-and-Rendering/tree_html_renderer.hpp, and functional.

## Story Groups

### Building The Working Picture
These steps assemble the trees, models, or bundles used by the rest of the file.
- build_creational_broken_tree(): Create the local output structure and connect local structures
- creational_tree_to_parse_tree_node(): store local findings, fill local output fields, and read local tokens
- creational_tree_to_text(): fill local output fields, connect local structures, and serialize report content

### Showing The Result
These steps turn internal state into text, HTML, JSON, or another output a reader can inspect.
- creational_tree_to_html(): read local tokens and render text or HTML views
