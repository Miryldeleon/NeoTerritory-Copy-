## Logic Summary
Private parse-tree implementation helpers used by the engine internals.

## Subsystem Story
This folder is mostly leaf-level. The local documents here carry the main explanation of the subsystem without requiring much extra descent.

### ParseTree Internals
These documents explain the local implementation by covering Implements parsing, shadow-tree building, symbolization, hash linking, rendering, and reporting. and Constructs file-local parse-tree nodes from tokenized source lines and scoped statements.

## Reading Hint
- This folder is mostly leaf-level. Read the local file docs to understand the logic in this area.
