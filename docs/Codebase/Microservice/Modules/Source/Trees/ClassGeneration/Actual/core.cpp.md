# core.cpp

- Source: `Microservice/Modules/Source/SyntacticBrokenAST/ParseTree/core.cpp`
- Kind: C++ implementation
- Role: actual parse-tree entrypoint for rooted source truth

## Folder Role
This file is the actual-branch entrypoint for `Trees/ClassGeneration/Actual/`.

## Quick Summary
This file owns the public parse-tree entrypoints. It creates the rooted `main_tree`, prepares per-file roots, calls the internal file parser, keeps the compatibility `shadow_tree`, and exposes text or HTML rendering helpers.

The actual branch is independent from `VirtualBroken/`. It records source truth and must produce the specific class-declaration subtree before structural pattern analysis or virtual-broken evidence assembly starts.

## File-Level Flow
This diagram shows only how the functions in this file relate to each other. Detailed steps are kept inside each function section so the same behavior is not repeated twice.

```mermaid

    N0["Caller provides source"]
    N1["Wrap memory source as file"]
    N2["Build full parse bundle"]
    N3["Return rooted main tree"]
    N4["Render tree as text"]
    N5["Render tree as HTML"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3
    N0 --> N2
    N3 --> N4
    N3 --> N5
```

## Function Map
- `build_cpp_parse_tree(source, context)` wraps an in-memory source string as a single file, then delegates to the file-list overload.
- `build_cpp_parse_tree(files, context)` builds the full bundle, then returns only `main_tree`.
- `build_cpp_parse_trees(files, context)` builds the full parse bundle with main tree, completed class-subtree candidates, traces, dependency metadata, and report counters.
- `parse_tree_to_text(root)` walks a tree and emits an indented text view.
- `parse_tree_to_html(root)` delegates HTML rendering to the renderer module.

## build_cpp_parse_tree(source, context)
This overload does not parse directly. It adapts a raw source string into a `SourceFileUnit` named `<memory>` and then uses the file-list overload.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Receive source text"]
    N1["Create memory file unit"]
    N2["Delegate to file-list overload"]
    N3["Return main tree"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3
```

## build_cpp_parse_tree(files, context)
This overload keeps the public API small. It asks `build_cpp_parse_trees()` for the full bundle and returns the rooted actual tree only.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Receive source files"]
    N1["Build parse bundle"]
    N2["Select main_tree"]
    N3["Return actual tree"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3
```

## build_cpp_parse_trees(files, context)
This is the real bundle builder in this file. It sets up roots, routes each file through the internal parser, records completed class-subtree candidates, resolves dependencies, builds symbol relevance, and keeps the transitional shadow tree for downstream compatibility.

### Slice 1 - Root And File Setup
Quick summary: This slice prepares the bundle-level roots and per-file child nodes.
Why this is separate: root setup is structural bookkeeping; it happens before any file content is parsed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Load C++ token config"]
    N1["Create main root"]
    N2["Create shadow root"]
    N3["Create candidate registry"]
    N4["Create file nodes"]
    N5["Map basename to path"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4 --> N5
```

### Slice 2 - Parse Files Into Actual Branch
Quick summary: This slice shows the file parsing loop and the class-declaration subtree records that later pattern analysis consumes.
Why this is separate: actual tree growth happens inside `parse_file_content_into_node()`, while this file only orchestrates the call and stores completed class candidates.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Iterate source files"]
    N1["Parse file into main branch"]
    N2["Finish class subtrees"]
    N3["Collect class definitions"]
    N4["Register subtree heads"]
    N5["Return actual bundle"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4 --> N5
```

### Slice 3 - Enrich Actual File Nodes
Quick summary: This slice resolves cross-file context after all files have actual tree nodes.
Why this is separate: include dependencies and symbol dependencies require the file-level class-definition map built during parsing.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Visit each file node"]
    N1["Resolve include paths"]
    N2["Collect symbol dependencies"]
    N3["Append dependency nodes"]
    N4["Bucketize file node"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4
```

### Slice 4 - Build Transitional Shadow Tree
Quick summary: This slice keeps the older filtered shadow output alive for downstream consumers.
Why this is separate: this is compatibility behavior, not the same lifecycle as class-subtree generation or later virtual-broken evidence.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Read crucial classes"]
    N1["Build symbol tables"]
    N2["Collect relevant hashes"]
    N3["Filter main children"]
    N4["Count kept or pruned nodes"]
    N5["Return bundle"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4 --> N5
```

## parse_tree_to_text(root)
This function renders one tree into an indented text representation. It recursively walks children, chooses the annotated display value when present, and prints hash metadata.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Start recursive walk"]
    N1["Write kind and value"]
    N2["Write context hash"]
    N3["Write usage hashes"]
    N4["Visit children"]
    N5["Return text"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4 --> N5
```

## parse_tree_to_html(root)
This function does not build HTML itself. It delegates to the HTML renderer with the fixed title `C++ Parse Tree`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N0["Receive parse tree"]
    N1["Call HTML renderer"]
    N2["Return HTML"]
    N0 --> N1 --> N2
```

## Reading Boundaries
- Entry references outside this file: callers use the public parse-tree functions from `parse_tree.hpp`.
- Exit references outside this file: content parsing is delegated to `Internal/parse_tree_internal.hpp`, and HTML output is delegated to the tree renderer.
- Internal diagrams in this file should stay focused on the functions listed above.

## Acceptance Checks
- The file-level diagram shows function relationships only.
- Function diagrams describe local behavior using short intent labels, not generic action buckets.
- Detailed steps for `build_cpp_parse_trees()` appear only in that function section.
- Cross-file references appear only as entry or exit boundaries.
- The actual class-declaration subtree is documented as the prerequisite for pattern analysis.
