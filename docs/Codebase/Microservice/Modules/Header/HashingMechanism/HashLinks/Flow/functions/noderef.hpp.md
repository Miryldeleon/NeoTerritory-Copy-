# noderef.hpp

- Source document: [parse_tree_hash_links.hpp.md](../../parse_tree_hash_links.hpp.md)
- Purpose: decoupled implementation logic for a future code unit.

### NodeRef
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract

Contract details:
- `NodeRef` should distinguish a registry head pointer from a child path reference.
- Head refs identify the class or function subtree owner.
- Child refs identify exact internal locations under that head, such as a member call lexeme or statement node.
