# parse_tree_hash_links_internal.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/SyntacticBrokenAST/Internal/parse_tree_hash_links_internal.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It is included before runtime execution begins so the C++ sources can agree on the shared data structures and function signatures.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It collaborates directly with ParseTree/Internal/parse_tree_hash_links_internal.hpp.
