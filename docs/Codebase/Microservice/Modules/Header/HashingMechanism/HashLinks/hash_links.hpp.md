# parse_tree_hash_links.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/SyntacticBrokenAST/ParseTree/parse_tree_hash_links.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It is included before runtime execution begins so the C++ sources can agree on the shared data structures and function signatures.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as NodeAncestry, NodeRef, FilePairedTreeView, and ClassHashLink. It collaborates directly with parse_tree.hpp, parse_tree_symbols.hpp, cstddef, and string.

## Program Flow
Detailed program flow is decoupled into future implementation units:

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: NodeAncestry, NodeRef, FilePairedTreeView, ClassHashLink, UsageHashLink, and HashLinkIndex.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as parse_tree.hpp, parse_tree_symbols.hpp, cstddef, string, and vector.

## Story Groups

### Head And Path Contract
- This file owns the all-nodes pointer index, not the semantic symbol facade.
- Hash links connect stable head-node identities to path evidence.
- Class and function registries own the head-node pointers.
- Child hashes and parent-tail keys identify the exact nested location after a head has been selected.
- Repeated visible names must be disambiguated with immediate parent context and file context.
- Member calls should resolve object-variable bindings before using the member name hash.

### Promises This File Makes
These entries tell the rest of the program what this file can provide.
- NodeAncestry: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- NodeRef: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- FilePairedTreeView: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- ClassHashLink: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- UsageHashLink: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- HashLinkIndex: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- build_parse_tree_hash_links(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body
