# factory_pattern_logic.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/Creational/Factory/factory_pattern_logic.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the creational subsystem. It declares the detectors, transforms, and helper types that the runtime sources later define.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares creational-pattern detection and transform interfaces. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as T and build_factory_pattern_tree. It collaborates directly with creational_broken_tree.hpp and parse_tree.hpp.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares creational-pattern detection and transform interfaces.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: T and build_factory_pattern_tree.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as creational_broken_tree.hpp and parse_tree.hpp.

## Story Groups

### Promises This File Makes
These entries tell the rest of the program what this file can provide.
- build_factory_pattern_tree(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body

## Function Stories

### build_factory_pattern_tree()
This declaration exposes a callable contract without providing the runtime body here.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body.

What it does:
- declare a callable contract
- let implementation files define the runtime body
