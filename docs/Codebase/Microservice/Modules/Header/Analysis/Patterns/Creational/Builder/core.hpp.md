# builder_pattern_logic.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/Creational/Builder/builder_pattern_logic.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the creational subsystem. It declares the detectors, transforms, and helper types that the runtime sources later define.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares creational-pattern detection and transform interfaces. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as BuilderMethodStructureCheck, BuilderStructureCheckResult, check_builder_pattern_structure, and assignments. It collaborates directly with creational_broken_tree.hpp, parse_tree.hpp, cstddef, and string.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of builder_pattern_logic.hpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for builder_pattern_logic.hpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: builder_pattern_logic.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for builder_pattern_logic.hpp after setup.
Why this is separate: builder_pattern_logic.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares creational-pattern detection and transform interfaces.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: BuilderMethodStructureCheck, BuilderStructureCheckResult, check_builder_pattern_structure, assignments, and build_builder_pattern_tree.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as creational_broken_tree.hpp, parse_tree.hpp, cstddef, string, and vector.

## Story Groups

### Promises This File Makes
These entries tell the rest of the program what this file can provide.
- BuilderMethodStructureCheck: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- BuilderStructureCheckResult: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- check_builder_pattern_structure(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body
- assignments(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body

## Function Stories

### BuilderMethodStructureCheck
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["BuilderMethodStructureCheck"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
    N1["Declare type"]
    N2["Expose contract"]
    N3["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### BuilderStructureCheckResult
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["BuilderStructureCheckResult"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
    N1["Declare type"]
    N2["Expose contract"]
    N3["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### check_builder_pattern_structure()
This declaration exposes a callable contract without providing the runtime body here.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body.

What it does:

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["check_builder_pattern_structure()"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
