# source_reader.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/SyntacticBrokenAST/Input-and-CLI/source_reader.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It is included before runtime execution begins so the C++ sources can agree on the shared data structures and function signatures.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as SourceFileUnit, read_source_file_units, and join_source_file_units. It collaborates directly with string and vector.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of source_reader.hpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for source_reader.hpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: source_reader.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for source_reader.hpp after setup.
Why this is separate: source_reader.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: SourceFileUnit, read_source_file_units, and join_source_file_units.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as string and vector.

## Story Groups

### Promises This File Makes
These entries tell the rest of the program what this file can provide.
- SourceFileUnit: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- read_source_file_units(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body
- join_source_file_units(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body

## Function Stories

### SourceFileUnit
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["SourceFileUnit"]
    N0["Execute file-local step"]
    N1["Declare type"]
    N2["Expose contract"]
    N3["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### read_source_file_units()
This declaration exposes a callable contract without providing the runtime body here.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body.

What it does:
- declare a callable contract
- let implementation files define the runtime body

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["read_source_file_units()"]
    N0["Read source file units"]
    N1["Declare call"]
    N2["Defer body"]
    N3["Hand back"]
    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### join_source_file_units()
This declaration exposes a callable contract without providing the runtime body here.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body.

What it does:
- declare a callable contract
- let implementation files define the runtime body

Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["join_source_file_units()"]
    N0["Join source file units"]
    N1["Declare call"]
