# parse_tree_symbols_internal.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/SyntacticBrokenAST/Internal/parse_tree_symbols_internal.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It is included before runtime execution begins so the C++ sources can agree on the shared data structures and function signatures.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as trim, starts_with, split_words, and class_name_from_signature. It collaborates directly with parse_tree_symbols.hpp, string, and vector.

## Program Flow
Detailed program flow is decoupled into future implementation units:

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: trim, starts_with, split_words, class_name_from_signature, function_name_from_signature, and function_parameter_hint_from_signature.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as parse_tree_symbols.hpp, string, and vector.
