# behavioural_broken_tree.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/Behavioural/behavioural_broken_tree.hpp
- Kind: C++ header

## Story
### What Happens Here

This header implements the compile-time contract for the behavioural subsystem. It defines the interfaces and hook declarations used when the generic parser delegates behavioural structure decisions.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Declares behavioural detection interfaces and structural-hook contracts. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as IBehaviouralDetector, IBehaviouralTreeCreator, detect, and create. It collaborates directly with parse_tree.hpp, string, and vector.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of behavioural_broken_tree.hpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Establish Local Entry
Quick summary: This slice shows the first file-local stage for behavioural_broken_tree.hpp and keeps the diagram scoped to this code unit.
Why this is separate: behavioural_broken_tree.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

#### Slice 2 - Handle Early Decisions
Quick summary: This slice shows the first local decision path for behavioural_broken_tree.hpp after setup.
Why this is separate: behavioural_broken_tree.hpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

## Reading Map
Read this file as: Declares behavioural detection interfaces and structural-hook contracts.

Where it sits in the run: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

Names worth recognizing while reading: IBehaviouralDetector, IBehaviouralTreeCreator, detect, create, build_behavioural_broken_tree, and behavioural_broken_tree_to_html.

It leans on nearby contracts or tools such as parse_tree.hpp, string, and vector.

## Story Groups

### Promises This File Makes
These entries tell the rest of the program what this file can provide.
- IBehaviouralDetector: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- IBehaviouralTreeCreator: Declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract
- build_behavioural_broken_tree(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body
- behavioural_broken_tree_to_html(): Declare a callable contract and let implementation files define the runtime body

## Function Stories

### IBehaviouralDetector
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract

Flow:

    End["Return"]
    Start --> N0
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> End
```

### IBehaviouralTreeCreator
This declaration introduces a shared type that other files compile against.

Inside the body, it mainly handles declare a shared type and expose the compile-time contract.

What it does:
- declare a shared type
- expose the compile-time contract
