## Story
### What Happens Here

This file is the compile-time assembly point for the C++ system. Its implementation chooses compiler defaults, sets the language standard, gathers microservice sources and headers, and then binds them into the single NeoTerritory executable with the include paths the parser and pattern modules expect.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### What To Watch While Reading

Builds the NeoTerritory executable from the microservice layer and module sources. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as cmake_minimum_required, if, set, and elseif.

## Program Flow
This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.
