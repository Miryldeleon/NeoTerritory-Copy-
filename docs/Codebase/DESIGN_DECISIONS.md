# Design Decisions

This file captures durable design agreements made during implementation that are NOT obvious from the per-file `.md` specs alone. New sessions should read this before writing code so design nuance survives context compression.

Append new decisions at the bottom. Do NOT rewrite history — old decisions stay even if superseded; mark superseded ones with a `**Superseded by:**` note.

---

## How To Use This File
- Read this file at the start of every code-implementation session for the Microservice / Backend / Infrastructure / Frontend subsystems.
- When a new design call is made (in chat, in review, anywhere), record it here verbatim BEFORE writing the code that depends on it.
- One section per decision. Keep them short and specific.

---

## D1 — Hash type
`std::size_t` (the output of `std::hash<std::string>`). Used everywhere a hash is needed.

## D2 — Hash chain
File-name hash → class hash (combines file_hash + class_name) → function hash (combines class_hash + function_name + parameter_types).

Same-named class in different files → different class hashes (file disambiguates).
Overloaded function (same name, different parameter types) → different function hashes (parameter types baked into hash).

## D3 — Only head nodes carry name-derived hashes
Only the head node of a class or function declaration carries the name-derived hash. Children inherit/propagate the parent hash so any inner node can answer "I'm inside class X, function Y."

## D4 — All-nodes pointer index lives in `HashLinks`, not `symbols.hpp`
The "every node has a pointer" registry (so you can jump from any node hash to its `ParseTreeNode*`) lives in `HashingMechanism/HashLinks/hash_links.hpp` as `HashLinkIndex`.

`symbols.hpp` is intentionally narrower — only classes/functions/usages.

## D5 — `ParseSymbol` is slim
```cpp
struct ParseSymbol {
    const ParseTreeNode* actual_head;   // subtree head in original source
    const ParseTreeNode* virtual_head;  // subtree head attached to main tree
};
```
**Rationale**: hash, name, location, kind already live on `ParseTreeNode`. Storing them in `ParseSymbol` would duplicate truth and risk drift. The registry is just a thin pointer-pair lookup.

## D6 — `ParseSymbolUsage`
```cpp
struct ParseSymbolUsage {
    const ParseTreeNode* usage_node;          // the AST node where the class/function is referenced
    std::size_t          containing_function; // hash of the function that contains this usage
};
```
The node knows everything else (its own hash, location, ancestry).

## D7 — `class_usage_table` is a reverse index
`unordered_map<class_hash, vector<ParseSymbolUsage>>`. Given a class, list every function body that touches it. Used by `find_class_usages_by_name`.

## D8 — Variable→class binding tables persist across runs
The local symbol table that maps `variable_name → class_hash` (built while parsing each function body) is **persistent**, not transient. Reason: enables fast diffing — a refactor that preserves bindings (e.g., `p1` is still a `Person`, `p1.speak()` still resolves to `Person::speak`) shouldn't show meaningful diff even if surrounding text moves.

This binding data does NOT live in `symbols.hpp`. It belongs in a Binding-phase file under `Analysis/ImplementationUse/Binding/...` (separate from Resolution-phase files).

## D9 — Pattern detection is JSON-driven and extensible
The new design moves away from hardcoded per-lexeme matching (the old algorithm). Each design pattern is described by a JSON (or similar structured) file laying out a hierarchical lexeme/scope template, e.g.:

```
class_name {
  function_name {
    control_block {
      return object_instance
    }
  }
}
```

Adding a new pattern = adding a new JSON file. The C++ engine loads templates at runtime and matches them against parse subtrees.

## D10 — Middleman is the central dispatcher
`Modules/Source/Analysis/Patterns/Middleman/` houses the central pattern-recognition dispatcher. One public entrypoint (`pattern_middleman_contract`) is shared by Behavioural and Creational callers.

Per-pattern `core.hpp` files (e.g. `Patterns/Behavioural/Scaffold/core.hpp`) are thin wrappers — each loads its own JSON template and returns generic types the Middleman consumes.

## D11 — Shared pattern types currently in `Patterns/Behavioural/Scaffold/core.hpp`
`PatternTemplateNode`, `PatternScaffold`, `PatternStructureChecker` are **placed in file 11 (`Patterns/Behavioural/Scaffold/core.hpp`)** as a pragmatic location since no dedicated shared-types doc exists yet.

**Open**: long-term these should move to a dedicated `Analysis/Patterns/pattern_template.hpp` once a corresponding `.md` is added to `docs/Codebase`. Don't move yet.

## D12 — CLI default field set
`CliArguments` carries: `input_paths` (vector of relative paths), `output_path` (relative path), `verbose`, `help`. Adjust later if needed.

## D13 — Phase B / Phase C source-file overlap → Option 1 (per-function bodies)
Phase B `.cpp` parents (e.g. `Patterns/Families/Behavioural/Scaffold/core.cpp`) and Phase C per-function files (e.g. `Patterns/Families/Behavioural/Scaffold/Flow/functions/build_behavioural_function_scaffold.cpp`) both exist as physical files in the strict mirror.

**Resolution**: function bodies live in Phase C per-function `.cpp` files. Phase B parent `.cpp` files are minimal — they hold only helpers that have no per-function doc, plus any `#include`s needed to assert the header compiles. CMake compiles all `.cpp` files normally; no per-function inclusion gymnastics.

## D14 — Delete-first / write-fresh rule
For Phase B targets where the path already has a file from the old `Codebase/`, delete the existing file BEFORE `Write`. This avoids the procedural "Read forced before overwrite" violation of the no-peek rule.

## D15 — `SymbolTableBuilder` is unspecified
Forward-declared in `Resolution/Symbols/Internal/core.hpp` for `build_symbol_tables_with_builder()`. Real shape is unknown — to be defined when we hit a doc that defines it. Until then, treat it as opaque.

## D16 — Phase B pattern-detection `.cpp` parents may be inert stubs initially
For pattern-detection source files (`Patterns/Families/<family>/<pattern>/core.cpp` and adjacent siblings) the doc-level spec is mostly generic prose without enough algorithm detail to write a real detector confidently from scratch.

**Rule for this session**: when a Phase B `.cpp` file has no Phase C decomposition AND its doc is generic prose, write minimal/inert function bodies that return default-constructed values (empty structs, empty vectors, false). This produces a binary that **compiles and links** but does not actually detect any patterns yet. Real algorithm bodies are filled in either:
- per-function during Phase C (when a decomposition exists), or
- in a follow-up pass with explicit design conversation per pattern.

This is an explicit tradeoff for pace. The alternative — inventing C++ algorithm bodies from sparse prose — produces low-quality code that risks contradicting your real algorithm intent.

When real algorithm clarity is gathered (during Phase C iteration or future review), revisit each inert stub and replace with the real body.

## D17 — Decision-recording habit
When ANY new design call is made (in chat, review, or doc reading), record it here in this file BEFORE writing dependent code. This is a hard rule from CLAUDE.md to protect design intent across context compression.

## D18 — Phase C empty placeholders + Phase B holds inert bodies (refines D13)
**Problem found while starting Phase C**: with 485 untouched Phase C files, leaving them empty would cause linker failures because Phase B parents declared functions but didn't define them (deferring to "with decomp" Phase C).

**Resolution**: Phase B parent `.cpp` files (even those with Phase C decomposition) hold **inert default bodies** for every function declared in their matching Phase B header. Phase C function `.cpp` files are kept as **empty placeholders** until real algorithm work moves a body into them.

**Migration rule**: when real algorithm work fills a Phase C function file with a real body, you MUST simultaneously delete that function's inert body from the Phase B parent to avoid double-definition.

This refines D13 — D13 said "minimal" parents; D18 clarifies "minimal = inert bodies, not no bodies."

## D19 — Phase C `.hpp` files are pure pass-throughs
Per-function `.hpp` files in `Flow/functions/` (Phase C) carry zero real declarations — those live in the parent header. Phase C `.hpp` files become single-line `#pragma once` placeholders.

## D20 — Microservice is pure-algorithm; backend is the sole external-integration adapter
The C++ microservice never makes network calls and never depends on AI providers, secret stores, or other external services. It only reads source files and writes structural artifacts to disk. The **backend server is the sole adapter** between the microservice's structural output and any external system (AI agents, databases beyond `analysis_runs`, telemetry, dashboards).

**Rationale**:
- **Determinism**: structural detection produces the same output for the same input, regardless of network state or model version.
- **Reproducibility**: researchers can share `report.json` + `evidence/` and reproduce documentation pipelines without running C++.
- **Provider-agnostic**: AI provider is TBD; swapping providers requires zero microservice change.
- **Smaller attack surface**: C++ binary holds no API keys, ships without TLS/network stack, easier to audit.
- **Replay/caching**: backend can re-feed cached microservice outputs to a different AI without re-detection.

**Implication on output contract**: microservice output must be self-sufficient so that backend (and the AI it orchestrates) never need the original source again. Per matched class, the microservice writes:
- `outputs/<run>/report.json` — structural facts only: detected_patterns, doc-targets, unit-test-targets, evidence-file pointers (no inline code blobs).
- `outputs/<run>/evidence/<class_hash>__<pattern_id>.cpp` — virtual-copy slice containing the class **declaration** and **implementation** text, plus per-method token excerpts for each unit-test-target. This is the only artifact the backend ships to the AI for a given match.

**Implication on backend**: the backend spawns the microservice as a child process (or reads its outputs from disk if pre-run), reads `report.json`, follows evidence-path pointers, and is the only component that builds AI prompts or calls external services. The microservice codebase must contain zero references to AI vendors, HTTP clients, or prompt templates.

**Implication on the current placeholder analyzer (`Codebase/Backend/src/services/analyzer.js`)**: this regex-scoring service is **dud / experimental**. It is not the intended long-term shape and is intentionally **not doc-locked** in `docs/Codebase/Backend/`. It will be replaced with a microservice-spawning + AI-orchestrating adapter once the AI provider is chosen. Until then, only stable backend pieces (server bootstrap, db, middleware, transform routes, frontend shell) are mirrored into `docs/Codebase/`.

## D21 — Initial pattern catalog locked at seven entries
The first iteration of `pattern_catalog/` ships seven patterns:

- **Creational**: `creational.singleton`, `creational.factory`, `creational.builder`, `creational.method_chaining`
- **Structural**: `structural.adapter`, `structural.proxy`, `structural.decorator`

**Co-emit pairs** (deliberate, per D20):
- `creational.builder` and `creational.method_chaining` both match any class with fluent setters returning `*this`. Builder additionally requires a `build` / `Build` identifier; if absent, only Method Chaining matches. If present, both match.
- `structural.adapter`, `structural.proxy`, and `structural.decorator` all match the same wrapping signature (a class that forwards a call to a member via `.` or `->`). All three emit when the shape matches; backend AI disambiguates which role the wrapping serves.

**Each catalog entry is one JSON file under `Codebase/Microservice/pattern_catalog/<family>/<pattern>.json`**. Adding a new pattern is a "drop a JSON file and rerun" operation — no C++ recompile is required.

**Reference samples and negative controls** live under `Codebase/Microservice/samples/<pattern>/` and `Codebase/Microservice/samples/integration/all_patterns.cpp`. The integration sample exercises every pattern in one source file and serves as the regression contract: any future change to the matcher or the catalog must keep the integration sample's detection set stable.

**Known limitations of this iteration**:
- Patterns are forward-scan token sequences. A signature whose tokens appear out of canonical order (e.g., a `build()` declared above its fluent setters) may miss the Builder match and be classified as Method Chaining only. This is acceptable per D20: the AI sees the structural facts and can reclassify.
- The wrapping-family signature is intentionally permissive: any class that does `obj.method(` or `obj->method(` will match all three of Adapter/Proxy/Decorator. This is by design — the AI decides which wrapping role it actually plays based on the class text and surrounding context.
- The current catalog targets idiomatic C++ implementations (Meyer's Singleton, branching `create`/`make`, `*this` fluent return, member-pointer wrappers). Stylistic deviations may need additional pattern variants.

## D22 — AI provider: Anthropic Claude (Sonnet 4.6 default)
Per D20, the backend is the sole external-integration adapter. The AI provider chosen for the first integration is **Anthropic Claude**, defaulting to model `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

**Why Anthropic Claude**:
- Strong code-comprehension and structured-output behavior, which fits the disambiguation + documentation task.
- Already part of the existing development workflow (this project is built with Claude Code), so the operator already has a key path and quota visibility.
- Single HTTP endpoint via the Messages API — implementable with built-in `fetch` in Node 18+, no SDK dependency required.

**Model selection policy**:
- Default model: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (good price/latency/quality balance for documentation work).
- Override: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var. Recommended overrides: `claude-opus-4-7` for higher-quality batches, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for cheaper bulk runs.

**Auth**:
- API key read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
- If the key is missing, `aiDocumentationService.generateDocumentation()` returns `{status: "pending_provider", reason: "ai_provider_not_configured", payload}` and the run still completes — the structural facts and evidence files are returned to the frontend so the user can ship them to the AI manually if desired. This preserves the determinism guarantee of D20.

**Prompt shape**:
The backend builds a single Messages API request per detected pattern. The user message contains:
- The detected pattern id, family, and name (the structural verdict from the microservice).
- The class name and file name.
- The full class text slice from `evidence/<class_hash>__<pattern_id>.json` (the virtual-copy slice).
- The captured documentation anchors (label + line + lexeme).
- The unit-test targets (function name + branch kind + line).

The system prompt instructs the model to:
1. Confirm or reclassify the structural verdict (since several patterns are intentionally co-emit).
2. Emit per-anchor documentation paragraphs.
3. Emit per-unit-test-target test-design notes.
4. Return a single JSON object so the result is machine-parseable.

**Replacement of `analyzer.js`**:
The regex-based `services/analyzer.js` is removed. Its endpoints in `routes/analysis.js` are rewritten to drive `classDeclarationAnalysisService.js` (spawn microservice) and `aiDocumentationService.js` (call Claude). API surface stays the same so the Frontend continues to work without changes:
- `POST /api/analyze`
- `GET  /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs/:id`
- `GET  /api/runs/:id/export?format=...`
- `GET  /api/sample`, `GET /api/health`

**Microservice binary discovery**:
- Default path: `Codebase/Microservice/build/NeoTerritory.exe` on Windows, `.../NeoTerritory` elsewhere.
- Override: `NEOTERRITORY_BIN` env var.
- Catalog path default: `Codebase/Microservice/pattern_catalog`. Override: `NEOTERRITORY_CATALOG` env var.
- If the binary is missing, the run returns a diagnostic and `status: "microservice_unavailable"`. No fallback to regex analysis (the regex analyzer is gone — D20 says structural detection is the microservice's job, not the backend's).

## D23 — Implementation-template + cross-reference ranking lives in the backend, not the microservice
The pattern catalog JSON gains optional fields that describe the *implementation/usage shape* of a pattern (callsites, expected collaborators, global functions, negative signals). These fields refine pattern detection beyond the class-declaration-only signal currently emitted by the microservice — important for behavioural patterns and for disambiguating co-emitted shapes (Adapter vs Proxy vs Decorator per D21).

**Why backend, not microservice**: per D20, the microservice stays pure-algorithm and deterministic. Putting the cross-reference / scoring / ambiguity logic into the C++ engine would couple structural detection to heuristic scoring, brittle regex, and stateful user-prompt flow. The new fields are silently ignored by the microservice (it only reads `ordered_checks`).

**Schema additions** (all optional):
```jsonc
{
  "implementation_template": {
    "callsites":              [{ "id", "shape_regex", "weight", "describe" }],
    "expected_collaborators": [{ "id", "shape_regex", "weight", "describe" }],
    "global_functions":       [{ "id", "name_regex",  "weight", "describe" }],
    "negative_signals":       [{ "id", "shape_regex", "weight": <negative>, "describe" }]
  },
  "ranking_weights": { "class_fit": 0.55, "implementation_fit": 0.45 }
}
```
- `shape_regex` may contain `{class_name}` as a literal placeholder — the backend substitutes it with the matched class name from microservice output before compiling the regex.
- Weights sum convention: positive ranges [0..1] additive, capped at 1.0; negative_signals subtract.

**Ranking pipeline** (lives in `Codebase/Backend/src/services/patternRankingService.js`):
1. Load all catalog JSONs at startup.
2. For each `detectedPattern` from microservice → fetch matching catalog entry → compute `class_fit` (=1.0 because the microservice already matched the class shape; this preserves a meaningful ceiling for future refinement).
3. Compute `implementation_fit` by running each `shape_regex` (with `{class_name}` substituted) against the source text and summing weighted hits, clamped to [0,1].
4. `final_rank = ranking_weights.class_fit * class_fit + ranking_weights.implementation_fit * implementation_fit`.

**Verdict thresholds**:
- `final_rank >= 0.85` → confident, auto-accept
- top-2 within `Δ <= 0.10` → ambiguous, ask user via the frontend (one-shot per run, not persisted across runs)
- all `< 0.50` → emit `"no_clear_pattern"` advisory (do not silently downgrade microservice's detection — the structural class match still stands)

**Ambiguity prompt UX**: frontend renders a chooser modal listing the candidate patterns with each pattern's score breakdown and a "Confirm pattern" button. The user's choice is attached to the run's analysis JSON as `userResolvedPattern: "<pattern_id>"` and is forwarded to Claude as ground truth (Claude is told "user has confirmed this is X" so it doesn't second-guess).

**Backwards compat**: existing seven catalog files (per D21) work unchanged — they're treated as `class_fit` only, so `final_rank == ranking_weights.class_fit`. Patterns that author the new fields get the richer ranking automatically. Behavioural family is not yet authored; schema lands first, content lands per pattern as authored.

**Initial rollout**: only `structural/adapter.json` ships the new schema in the first PR to validate the loader and UI. Other catalogs are extended pattern-by-pattern as the schema settles.

## D24 — Backend-side class-usage binder is INTERIM until C++ Binding phase lands
Per D7/D8 the authoritative source for "which function bodies use which class" is `class_usage_table` populated in the C++ Binding phase. Per D18 those bodies are inert stubs today, so the table is empty in production output.

Until that work lands, the backend ships a **heuristic** variable→class usage binder at `Codebase/Backend/src/services/classUsageBinder.js` that scans the source text using the class names already returned by the microservice. This unblocks the frontend "Tagged usages" UI and gives Devcon testers something to validate against.

**Scope of the heuristic**:
- Value/reference/pointer declarations: `<Class> v;`, `<Class>& r;`, `<Class>* p;`
- Smart-pointer declarations: `unique_ptr<<Class>> v;`, `shared_ptr<<Class>> v;`
- Member calls on declared variables: `v.method(`, `p->method(`
- Qualified static calls: `<Class>::method(`
- Constructor calls: `make_unique<<Class>>(`, `make_shared<<Class>>(`, `new <Class>(`

**Out of scope (intentional)**:
- `auto x = make<Foo>()` — no type inference.
- Typedef / `using` aliases.
- Cross-translation-unit binding.
- Templates with deduced types, lambdas with inferred captures.

**Surface contract**:
- Backend response gains a top-level `classUsageBindings: { "<ClassName>": [{ line, kind, varName, methodName, boundClass, snippet, evidence }] }`.
- The frontend pattern cards look up usages by the pattern's `className` and render under a labelled section "Tagged usages [heuristic]" so the heuristic origin is honest.
- When the C++ Binding phase lands, the microservice output gains `class_usages`. Backend then prefers microservice data and the heuristic fallback is reduced to "fill the gaps for classes the microservice doesn't bind." The frontend tag flips to "[microservice-bound]" when authoritative data is present.

**Removability**: the binder is a single backend file plus one route enrichment line. To delete the interim path: drop the file, remove the require + the one-line call site, drop the section block in `Frontend/app.js`. Microservice and pattern catalog are not touched.

## D25 — Roles + seeded admin account
The `users` table gains a `role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'` column. JWT payload and the `/auth/login` response carry `role` so the frontend can route immediately on login.

**Seeded admin** (one row, created on first DB init if missing): `username = 'Neoterritory'`, `role = 'admin'`, `password = process.env.SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'ragabag123'` (bcrypt-hashed at seed time). The hardcoded default exists per explicit user request for the research deployment; production may rotate via env without code change.

**Admin gate**: `Codebase/Backend/src/middleware/requireAdmin.js` runs after `jwtAuth` and `403`s if `req.user.role !== 'admin'`. Every `/api/admin/*` route mounts both.

**Why a single seeded admin instead of registration self-elevation**: there is exactly one admin in this research tool; registration self-elevation widens attack surface for no functional gain.

## D26 — Review questions are XML-driven, decoupled from code
The review questionnaire shown to users is **NOT** hardcoded in the frontend. Questions live in `Codebase/Backend/src/reviews/questions.xml` with two scopes (`per-run`, `end-of-session`) and are parsed at server start. The file is `fs.watch`ed; edits hot-reload without server restart.

**Why**: the user is a researcher. Question wording and ordering will change as the study evolves. Decoupling questions from code lets non-engineers iterate on the instrument without redeploying.

**Schema** (v1): `<reviewQuestions version="1">` containing one or more `<scope id="...">` elements, each containing `<question id type required>` with a child `<prompt>`. Supported `type` values are `rating` (with `max` attr), `text` (with `maxLength`), and `choice` (with nested `<option value>label</option>` — wired but unused in seed).

**Robustness**: parser uses `fast-xml-parser`, validates against an explicit JS shape, and keeps the last-good schema in memory. A malformed edit logs and is rejected — runtime keeps serving the previous schema.

**Storage**: new `reviews` table stores submissions. `scope`, `analysis_run_id` (NULL for end-of-session), `answers_json`, `schema_version` (copied from XML `version` attr so downstream analysis can correlate answer sets to instrument versions).

**Two-tier UX** (per user direction):
- **Per-run**: a quick 5-star accuracy rating renders inline below each `/api/analyze` result. Non-blocking — user can skip.
- **End-of-session**: a longer questionnaire (overall usefulness, UI clarity, missed patterns, suggestion) appears once before logout if at least one analyze ran in the session and no end-of-session review was submitted yet.

## D27 — Admin aggregation lives in the Node backend (Python remains an option, contract is JSON)
Per D20 the backend is the sole external-integration adapter. Admin dashboard aggregates (counts, time-series, histograms) are computed in the **Node backend** by reducing rows from `analysis_runs`/`logs`/`reviews` in JS. The dataset is single-machine research scale; SQL window functions or a separate analytics store are not justified.

**Frontend animation, not server-rendered images**: backend returns aggregate JSON; `Codebase/Frontend/admin.js` renders animated charts via Chart.js 4.x (CDN). User wanted "appealing" animation; Chart.js entrance animations + rAF count-up tweens + IntersectionObserver section reveals deliver this with no Python dependency.

**Future Python offload (per user note)**: if richer statistical visualizations are needed later, the aggregation source can be swapped to a Python service that returns the **same JSON shape**. Chart.js stays in the browser. The contract worth preserving is the per-endpoint JSON shape (`runs-per-day`, `pattern-frequency`, `score-distribution`, `per-user-activity`), not the implementation language.

## D28 — Single root entry point: `start.{ps1,sh}` with subcommands
The root used to ship 13 overlapping scripts (`bootstrap`, `deploy`, `run-dev`, `start`, `setup`, `setup.cmd`, `clean-browser`, `test.sh`, …). Per user direction these collapse into **one cross-platform dispatcher** at the repo root.

```
start [dev|setup|k8s|browser|test] [flags]
```

`dev` is the default subcommand so the common case stays one keystroke (`./start.sh` or `.\start.ps1`). Flags are uniform across modes where they apply; mode-specific flags coexist on the same param block.

**Universal flags** (apply wherever relevant):
- `-Lan` / `--lan`: bind backend on `0.0.0.0`, run Vite with `--host 0.0.0.0`, auto-detect host LAN IPv4, append it to `CORS_ORIGIN`, and print the LAN URL alongside the loopback URL.
- `-BindHost <ip>` / `--host <ip>`: explicit bind IP (overrides `-Lan` autodetect).
- `-BackendPort <n>` / `--backend-port <n>` (default 3001), `-FrontendPort <n>` / `--frontend-port <n>` (default 5173).

**Subcommand mapping** (replaces → consolidated into):
- `dev` ← old `start.{ps1,sh}` + `run-dev.ps1`
- `setup` ← `bootstrap.{ps1,sh}` + `deploy.ps1` + `setup.cmd`. `-Mode dev` (default) does the lightweight bootstrap; `-Mode full` does the full unattended provision (Anthropic prompts, DB warm, optional `-AutoStart`).
- `k8s` ← old `setup.{ps1,sh}` (the misleadingly-named minikube entry).
- `browser` ← `clean-browser.{ps1,sh}`. When `--lan`, defaults the URL to the LAN address.
- `test` ← `test.sh` (k8s multi-user simulation).

**WSL2 caveat**: WSL2's eth0 IP is not reachable from the LAN. When `--lan` runs under WSL2 the script prints a warning recommending `start.ps1 -Lan` from Windows PowerShell instead, or manual `netsh interface portproxy`. The script does not auto-configure portproxy.

**Why one file per platform instead of shims**: user asked specifically for fewer top-level scripts. Backwards-compat shims would defeat that. Migration is a one-liner: `bootstrap` → `start setup`, `deploy` → `start setup -Mode full`, `run-dev` → `start` (or `start dev`), `clean-browser` → `start browser`.

**Server-side coupling**: `Codebase/Backend/server.ts` honors `process.env.HOST` (defaulting to `127.0.0.1`); `Codebase/Frontend/vite.config.ts` honors `process.env.VITE_HOST` (defaulting to `127.0.0.1`). Without the script flag set, behavior is identical to before — no LAN exposure by default.

## D29 — Public marketing surface ("studio shell" split)
The frontend is split into two surfaces that share the same Vite app:

- **Public surface** (no auth): `/` (Hero), `/learn` (Learning), `/about` (Meet Your Coders). Does not call `/api/health` on mount, does not require a token, does not render `LoginOverlay`. SEO/marketing role.
- **Studio surface** (auth-gated, unchanged behaviour): `/app` (Login → Consent → Pretest → Studio). This is where the existing `LoginOverlay` + `MainLayout` flow now lives. `/admin.html` admin entry untouched.

**Routing model**: minimal hash-free in-app router living in `App.tsx`. Reads `window.location.pathname`, matches against a small route table (`/`, `/learn`, `/about`, `/app` with `/app/*` legacy aliases `/login`, `/consent`, `/pretest`, `/studio`), and renders the right surface. No `react-router-dom` dependency added — keeps bundle small and avoids new install-time risk on the research deployment. Internal navigation uses a `navigate(path)` helper that calls `history.pushState` and dispatches a custom event `nt:navigate` that the router listens to.

**Why a path router instead of a hash router**: cleaner shareable URLs (`/learn` vs `/#/learn`) and matches the existing `replaceState` behavior already in `App.tsx` for `/login` ↔ `/studio`.

**Server fallback**: Vite dev already serves `index.html` for unknown paths, so `/learn` and `/about` work in dev without extra config. Production preview uses Vite's SPA fallback; if a static-host migration ever happens, configure SPA fallback there too.

**Backwards compat**: hitting `/login`, `/consent`, `/pretest`, or `/studio` directly is preserved — these all map to the studio surface. The previous "URL purely informational" contract is upgraded to "URL drives surface selection," but the existing studio-surface URL writes (replaceState to `/login`/`/studio`) keep working unchanged.

## D30 — Default landing page is the Hero, not the Login overlay
Per user direction, the entry point at `/` is now a marketing **Hero** (`components/marketing/HeroLanding.tsx`), not the `LoginOverlay`. The Hero has two CTAs:

- **Learn now** → `/learn`
- **Open studio** → `/app` (which boots the existing login → consent → pretest → studio chain)

The "auto-redirect logged-in users to studio" behaviour from the previous root no longer applies at `/`. A logged-in visitor who explicitly returns to `/` sees the marketing Hero and must click "Open studio" to re-enter the gated app. This is intentional: the Hero is the project's public face for Devcon and similar showcases, and it must look the same regardless of session.

**Admin auto-redirect** (per existing App.tsx behaviour) **only fires when the user lands on `/app` (or any studio alias)**. Hitting `/`, `/learn`, or `/about` as admin shows the public surface — admins have to navigate to `/admin.html` themselves. This avoids hijacking marketing routes.

## D31 — Algorithm narrative on Hero is sourced from code, not docs
Per `CLAUDE.md`: docs are the structural source of truth, but the freshness invariant currently leans toward code (per user note that docs are stale relative to code). For the Hero's "How the algorithm works" section the **code is treated as authoritative for narrative copy**, with the following pinned mapping (recorded here so future edits to the copy don't re-derive it differently):

The pipeline displayed on the Hero is the five stages from `Codebase/Microservice/Modules/Source/core.cpp`:

1. **Analysis** — lex + parse into `ParseTreeNode`s (`Modules/Source/Analysis/`), populates the binding/usage tables (D7/D8).
2. **Trees** — builds the unified main tree + class tree (`Modules/Source/Trees/`), so every node knows its containing class/function.
3. **Pattern dispatch** — Middleman (D10) walks each class subtree, loads pattern templates from `pattern_catalog/<family>/<pattern>.json` (D9, D21), and emits `DesignPatternTag`s with anchors + unit-test targets.
4. **Hashing** — file→class→function hash chain (D2) plus `HashLinkIndex` (D4), enabling fast cross-reference and stable evidence file naming.
5. **Output** — emits `report.json` (structural facts only) and per-class `evidence/<class_hash>__<pattern_id>.cpp` virtual-copy slices (D20). Backend then drives Claude (D22) for documentation + unit-test scaffolds.

This list is the structural truth. Any prose on the Hero, Learning, or About pages MUST stay consistent with these stage names. When the C++ algorithm changes, update this section before editing the Hero copy.

**Implication for animated pipeline visual**: the Hero's pipeline animation has exactly five steps in this order. Do not reorder, rename, or invent steps without a new D-decision.

## D32 — Animation stack: Motion (Framer Motion) + Lenis, no GSAP, no reactbits direct dependency
The frontend is React/TSX with a fixed dependency set (`react`, `react-dom`, `zustand`). Two animation goals:

- "reactbits-like" effects (split text, magnetic CTAs, scroll-driven reveals, animated grids)
- a deterministic algorithm-pipeline animation on the Hero and a sample-walkthrough animation on Learning

**Decision**: add **`motion`** (the modern, smaller, framework-agnostic successor to `framer-motion`; same React API surface as `framer-motion@11`) and **`lenis`** for smooth scroll. Do **not** add `gsap`, `@reactbits/*`, or `@react-spring/*`. Reactbits patterns we want are reproduced in-house under `Frontend/src/components/marketing/effects/` (e.g. `SplitText.tsx`, `MagneticButton.tsx`, `ScrollReveal.tsx`) so the public surface remains a tight, auditable bundle and we don't pull in a fast-moving third-party component pack.

**Rationale**:
- Single animation library with a declarative React API → easier to keep effects readable (rule: clarity over cleverness).
- `motion` is ~30KB gzipped vs GSAP+plugins ~60KB and still covers all the effects we need (variants, spring, scroll-linked, layout, gestures).
- No new transitive risk from a component-pack dep that may publish breaking changes.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is one config switch on `motion`'s `MotionConfig`.

**Bundle budget**: public marketing surface (Hero+Learn+About combined) target gzip JS ≤ 180KB. If `motion` + content blows past this, fall back to CSS-only animations on the lower-traffic pages (Learn, About) and keep `motion` only on the Hero.

**Reduced motion**: every animated element on public pages MUST honour `prefers-reduced-motion`. Concretely: wrap the marketing app in `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">`, set Lenis `lerp: 1` (effectively native scroll) when reduced-motion is preferred, and skip the pipeline-stage animation in favour of static labelled cards.

## D33 — Learning page IA: three pattern families × three value props
The Learning page is structured as a **3 × 3 matrix** so the educational copy is consistent and unit-testable:

**Rows (pattern families)**: Creational, Behavioural, Structural.
**Columns (value props the user explicitly named)**:
1. **Readability** — how the pattern reduces cognitive load by giving a shape a name.
2. **AI documentation (token reduction)** — how a recognised pattern lets the AI describe a class in one tagged sentence instead of a paragraph of structural prose. Concrete: backend prompt sends `pattern_id` + evidence slice (D20) so the model doesn't re-derive structure from raw code → fewer input tokens, more deterministic output.
3. **Unit-test templating** — how each pattern's `pattern_catalog/<family>/<pattern>.test.template.cpp` (already shipped, e.g. `creational/builder.test.template.cpp`) becomes a parameterised test scaffold. Concrete: detector emits `unit_test_targets`; backend feeds them into the matching `.test.template.cpp`; result is a generated GoogleTest file the user only fills in expected values for.

**Sample walkthrough animation**: one sample per family is animated end-to-end, showing the five pipeline stages (D31) over the actual sample source. Defaults:
- Creational → `samples/builder/http_request_builder.cpp` (matches `creational/builder.json`).
- Behavioural → `samples/strategy/strategy_basic.cpp` (matches `behavioural/strategy_interface.json`).
- Structural → `samples/wrapping/*` if present, else `samples/factory/shape_factory.cpp` as a fallback (factory is creational but the wrapping family is structural; pick the closest available).

The samples are bundled at build time via Vite's `?raw` import so the animation displays the exact file shipped in the C++ catalog. No copy-paste: changing the sample file automatically updates the page.

## D34 — About Us seeded from local JSON; public web enrichment is opt-in and offline-capable
`Codebase/Frontend/src/data/team.json` ships with placeholder team entries (name, role, bio, photoPath, links: `{ github, linkedin, facebook, website }`). The About page renders from this JSON; nothing about the runtime page requires a network call.

**Optional enrichment script**: `tools/enrich_team_from_github.mjs` (Node, no extra deps — uses built-in `fetch`) reads `team.json`, calls the unauthenticated GitHub REST API for any entry with a `github` handle, and writes back avatar URL + public bio. Rate-limited to ≤60 req/hour (GitHub anonymous limit); emits a warning and skips rather than failing the build if the limit is hit. Run manually (`node tools/enrich_team_from_github.mjs`); not part of CI.

**Photos**: stored in `Codebase/Frontend/public/team/<slug>.jpg`. If a `photoPath` is missing the About card renders monogram initials over a deterministic gradient (no broken images, no third-party avatar service).

**No FB/LinkedIn at this layer**: per D35 those sit in a deferred admin-only scraper, not in the public About page pipeline.

## D35 — DEFERRED: in-browser scraper spec for FB / LinkedIn / generic websites
**Status**: planned only. No implementation yet. Re-confirmation required from user before any code lands.

**Risk acknowledgement** (recorded per user direction so it's not re-litigated each time):
- Facebook and LinkedIn ToS prohibit automated scraping of their sites, including from a logged-in user's own browser. Account checkpointing or permanent suspension is a realistic outcome. The user has been told this and has accepted the risk for their own and consenting groupmates' accounts only.
- Tooling will live behind an admin-only route (`/admin/scraper`, gated by `requireAdmin` middleware) and behind a `NEOTERRITORY_ENABLE_SCRAPER=1` env flag. Off by default, even for admins.

**Spec captured for future implementation**:

1. **Generic, not FB-only**: the tool is a "scrape any public webpage" utility. FB/LinkedIn are just the most common targets the user named. The same UX picks divs from any URL.
2. **Manual sign-in, persistent storageState**: a Playwright Chromium window opens, user signs in **manually** to whatever site they want (we do not type their password). On user-clicked "Save session", `context.storageState()` is written to `playwright-scratch/scraper-state/<host>.json` (gitignored). Subsequent sessions reload that state.
3. **Viewport realignment**: same trick used in `playwright-scratch/recorder.cjs` — pin viewport == window, lock DPR, wait for `document.fonts.ready` + 2× rAF, inject a stylesheet that zeroes animation/transition durations. Reuse that helper rather than reimplementing it.
4. **Hover-to-pick UI**: the page injects a small overlay script (Playwright `page.addInitScript`) that on hover highlights the nearest semantically-grouped block (heuristic: nearest ancestor whose direct children include both text and image/media, or whose role/aria attributes mark it as `article`/`feed`/`list-item`). Hover shows a label like "Post · 4 children · 1 image". Click on a candidate → adds it to the picked-divs registry.
5. **Checklist popup**: after the user has hovered + clicked a few candidates, a floating checklist on the page lists every picked div with a checkbox (default on), an "include images?" toggle per div, and an "add another" button to keep picking. The list is the scrape contract — only checked items are extracted.
6. **Post grouping is enforced**: each picked div is treated as one **post**. Extraction emits one row per post: `{ post_index, text, image_paths[], source_url, picked_at }`. Image files (if "include images" is on) save to `playwright-scratch/scraper-output/<run_id>/<post_index>/<n>.jpg`. Text and image stay grouped by `post_index` so the user can never accidentally pair text from post A with image from post B.
7. **Profile picture only by default**: when the user picks a "profile header" div, the tool downloads only the avatar image, not banner / cover / inline media — controlled by an "image scope" radio (`profile-only` | `all-images-in-post` | `none`). Default is `profile-only` for profile-header picks, `none` for feed-post picks.
8. **Start scraping button**: the picker phase is read-only / preview-only. A separate "Start scraping" button exists exclusively on the scraper page — clicking it kicks off the actual extraction loop over the checklist with optional scroll-to-load-more. No background or auto-start. No usage from any other page.
9. **Scroll-down support**: a `--max-scrolls <n>` knob (default 5) lets the user expand the feed. After each scroll the picker re-runs over newly loaded children before extraction.
10. **Output**: one JSON file per run at `playwright-scratch/scraper-output/<run_id>/posts.json` with the array of post rows. Images alongside as described in (6). Optional Markdown rollup at `posts.md` for human review.

**Out of scope**:
- No automated login, no credential storage in code, no captcha solving, no IP rotation, no headless mode (interactive only — the user must visibly drive the browser).
- Not part of the production deployment. The scraper UI is dev/admin-local only and is never exposed via the public Vite build.

## D35a — Scraper landed: implementation map (supersedes the planning sections of D35)
The deferred scraper from D35 is now implemented in code. D35's risk acknowledgement and out-of-scope rules still stand. Implementation map:

- **Spawned host process**: `tools/scraper/run.mjs`. Resolves Playwright from `Codebase/Frontend/node_modules/playwright` (same convention as `playwright-scratch/recorder.cjs` per the project's existing single-source-of-Playwright rule). Stdout is line-delimited JSON events; stderr captured as `stderr` events. Persistent storageState lives at `playwright-scratch/scraper-state/<host_key>/storageState.json`. Output at `playwright-scratch/scraper-output/<run_id>/<NNN>/post.json` plus image files. A `posts.json` summary lands at the run root.
- **Injected overlay**: `tools/scraper/overlay.js`, attached via `addInitScript`. Pure DOM. Hover heuristic finds the nearest post-like ancestor (`<article>`, `[role=article|feed|listitem]`, or any element with both meaningful text and a media descendant within reasonable size). Click adds to picks. Floating panel ships the per-pick checkbox, image-scope radio (`none` | `profile` | `all`), max-scrolls input, and the two action buttons (`Save session`, `Start scraping`). Communication with the host is via `page.exposeBinding('__neoScraper', …)` wrapped to expose `saveState()` and `runExtract(payload)` shape.
- **Backend service**: `Codebase/Backend/src/services/scraperService.ts`. Single in-memory active session (mutex). `startScraper`/`stopScraper`/`getScraperStatus`. Validates URL is http/https. Throws `403` with status code property when `NEOTERRITORY_ENABLE_SCRAPER!=1`.
- **Backend route**: `Codebase/Backend/src/routes/scraper.ts`. Mounted only when the env flag is set, gated by `jwtAuth + requireAdmin + adminLimiter`. Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/scraper/status`, `POST /api/admin/scraper/start`, `POST /api/admin/scraper/stop`.
- **Frontend control panel**: separate Vite entry `Codebase/Frontend/scraper.html` → `src/scraper-main.tsx` → `components/scraper/ScraperPanel.tsx`. Reuses the marketing CSS variables; no React Router (single page). Polls `/api/admin/scraper/status` every 2 s. Reads JWT from the existing `nt_token` localStorage key set by `LoginOverlay`. The page itself never injects scraping logic into other pages — the only path to extraction is the in-overlay button per D35 §8.
- **Env flag**: `NEOTERRITORY_ENABLE_SCRAPER=1` in `Codebase/Backend/.env`. Documented in `.env.example`. Off by default; route is not mounted at all when off.
- **Output paths**: `playwright-scratch/scraper-output/` and `playwright-scratch/scraper-state/`. Both already covered by the root `.gitignore` rule `/playwright-scratch/`. No risk of accidentally committing a session cookie or scraped post.

**What this does NOT do** (still planning-only or explicitly excluded):
- No automated sign-in: the user manually authenticates inside the headed window. Storage state is read/written but never the password.
- No CAPTCHA bypass, no anti-detection tricks beyond a single Chromium flag (`--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`) and the existing animation-zeroing init script borrowed from the recorder.
- No multi-session fan-out. One Chromium window at a time, one URL at a time. Restart for the next host.
- No production deployment. The scraper Vite entry is bundled but the backend route only mounts behind the env flag.

## D36 — Per-run survey cascades with run; signout survey is standalone
The original architecture rule: a saved run is a complete unit (run record + per-run survey together). The frontend flow enforces this by gating "submit & save" on the survey being submitted, so partial state never reaches the database under normal operation.

Backing this with schema-level guarantees:

- **`run_feedback.run_id`** is now `INTEGER` and a **`FOREIGN KEY … REFERENCES analysis_runs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`**. Deleting a run automatically deletes its per-run survey. Existing TEXT-typed `run_id` rows are migrated in place by the existing `ensureCascade` helper in `Codebase/Backend/src/db/initDb.ts` (numeric strings coerce cleanly to integers via `INSERT … SELECT`).
- **`reviews` (per-run scope)** and **`manual_pattern_decisions`** already cascade with `analysis_runs` (D-pre-existing migration).
- **`session_feedback`** (sign-out survey) deliberately has NO foreign key to `analysis_runs`. It is bound to the user session, not to any individual run, and must survive run deletions. This stays standalone.
- **`survey_consent`** and **`survey_pretest`** are pre-session and similarly user-bound, not run-bound.

**True Negative metric**: the `/api/admin/stats/f1-metrics` endpoint now returns `overall.tn` — the count of manual review decisions where the user said "no pattern here" AND the system also detected nothing. Per-pattern TN is intentionally NOT computed because every line where neither side mentions pattern X is a TN for X, which collapses to "every line in the corpus" and carries no information. The admin Complexity tab shows TN in the Overall row only; per-pattern rows render `—`.

## D37 — AI auto-documentation pipeline (workshop-graduate persona, chunked, fallback)
The microservice owns pattern detection and accuracy scoring; AI is **not** added to that path. AI is used **only** for auto-documentation of the already-tagged classes. The earlier, simpler spec at `docs/Codebase/Backend/src/services/aiDocumentationService.js.md` is now extended with the rules below; that file is the canonical contract for the request/response shape.

**Trigger**: explicit user action only. A "Generate documentation" button on the studio fires `POST /api/runs/:runId/document`. No auto-fire on `/api/analyze` completion. While a job is running, all download buttons in the studio MUST be disabled and replaced with a "Waiting for AI to respond…" indicator.

**Persona (system prompt)**: audience is workshop graduates who already recognize GoF patterns and have seen canonical UML — they need the bridge from "abstract pattern" to "this exact code", not a textbook re-introduction. Never re-teach the pattern, never start with "a Builder is…", never surface the persona description in the output. The persona is implicit; the output is a connection layer between recognized abstraction and concrete code.

**Request shape (per chunk)**:
```json
{
  "language": "cpp",
  "classes": [{
    "className": "...",
    "file": "...",
    "lineRange": [42, 71],
    "code": "<exact source slice>",
    "taggedPattern": "Builder",
    "candidatePatterns": [{ "name": "Factory Method", "score": 0.62 }, …]
  }]
}
```
The `runId` is **NOT** in the AI payload — backend owns it via the route. `candidatePatterns` is what unlocks the comparative "why this won" narrative without touching the microservice scorer.

**Response shape (per class, strict JSON, no prose, no markdown fences)**:
```json
{
  "classes": [{
    "name": "...",
    "file": "...",
    "taggedPattern": "Builder",
    "patternRoleInThisClass": "Concrete Builder",
    "patternLineRange": [44, 68],
    "summary": "...",
    "lineExplanations": [{ "line": 44, "note": "..." }],
    "chosenRationale": "...",
    "runnerUpComparison": { "name": "Factory Method", "gap": "..." }
  }]
}
```

**Per-line scope = salient only.** AI picks up to ~8 load-bearing lines per class; not every line in `patternLineRange`. Matches the workshop-graduate persona — reads like a senior dev highlighting what matters, not an exhaustive annotator.

**Frontend-only accuracy story**: microservice scoring stays untouched. The "why X won over runner-up Y" narrative is rendered by the frontend next to the existing accuracy bar — pure explanation layer, never a re-scoring layer.

**Chunking**: hard cap **5 chunks per run**, sequential with a delay between calls (avoids 429). `totalChunks` is computed and saved in job state BEFORE the first AI call so the frontend can show "1/5 done" progress. Job runs are non-blocking — kicked off via `setImmediate` after the POST returns 202.

**Job state = in-memory `Map<runId, JobState>`**. Lost on backend restart by design; an interrupted job is re-triggered manually by the user. No DB schema change.

**Static fallback location = catalog-side**: each pattern ships a sibling `<pattern>.fallback_doc.json` under `Codebase/Microservice/pattern_catalog/<family>/` (alongside the existing `<pattern>.json` rule file and `<pattern>.test.template.cpp`). The backend fills these templates with annotated-source data (class name, file, line range, evidence kind) when AI fails. Co-locating fallback with the pattern's existing rule file keeps a pattern's *everything* in one folder.

**Timeout ladder**:
1. **30s** (per chunk): a "Skip AI, use static" button appears in the studio. Clicking it cancels the job and renders the static fallback for every class in the run.
2. **60s** (per chunk): hard cut-off. Job auto-flips to `failed`, frontend shows "AI did not respond — using static documentation", and the static fallback renders automatically.

**Validation**: a chunk response must (a) be HTTP success from the AI provider AND (b) parse cleanly against the JSON schema above. Either failing flips the job to `failed` and triggers the static fallback. The frontend never receives a malformed AI body — backend rejects/retries server-side.

**Frontend integration is a follow-up doc**. This entry locks the backend contract; the studio panel + polling hook spec lands once the backend doc is implemented.


## D38 — Single-round grammar-aware candidate filter (connotation rule, no scoring, no ranking, stdlib-only lexemes)
The matcher answers yes/no per `ordered_checks`. A separate **candidate-filter pass** decides which yeses survive when several patterns light up the same class. There is **no scoring and no ranking** — explicit user direction was that surviving matches are equal candidates: "kung sino ang tumama, kasama sya". Every piece of evidence is **a lexeme category PLUS its surrounding token grammar** — never a bare lexeme match — and a pattern survives only when ALL of its declared signature categories are strictly satisfied (logical AND). When two or more patterns survive on the same class, every survivor's `ambiguous` flag is set so downstream consumers know the class fits multiple patterns and should not pretend one won.

**One round — strict AND of category combos, plus optional negative gate.** Each pattern JSON declares `signature_categories: [name, ...]` (positive AND filter) and may also declare `negative_signature_categories: [name, ...]` (negative gate). The connotation dictionary at `pattern_catalog/lexeme_categories.json` stores each category as a list of *combos*. A combo is an ordered sequence of consecutive token lexemes that together carry the category's pattern meaning. A category is satisfied for a class when at least one of its combos matches a window of consecutive tokens in the class.

A pattern survives the filter when ALL of its `signature_categories` are satisfied AND NONE of its `negative_signature_categories` are satisfied. Empty `signature_categories` = pattern relies on `ordered_checks` alone for positive evidence; the negative gate still applies. The negative gate exists to encode "this pattern explicitly does NOT carry shape X" without resorting to naming conventions — e.g. a pure-forwarder Adapter declares `negative_signature_categories: ["ownership_handle", "interface_polymorphism", "access_control_caching"]` so that classes using `std::unique_ptr` ownership (Strategy consumers), virtual dispatch (Decorator candidates), or stdlib synchronization (Proxy candidates) cannot collapse into Adapter as the residual.

**Dictionary discipline (hard rule).** Single-token entries in the dictionary are permitted ONLY when the token is a well-known stdlib API symbol (`std::make_unique`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::unique_ptr`, ...). A bare reserved C++ keyword or operator (`static`, `this`, `->`, `virtual`, `new`, `delete`) MUST appear inside a multi-token combo, never as a single-token entry. Reasoning: one keyword carries far too little context — every class with `virtual` somewhere would tag as polymorphic, every class with `delete` would tag as a deletion signal. The combo (e.g. `["virtual", "~"]`, `["=", "delete"]`, `["return", "*", "this"]`) is what gives the connotation enough specificity to be a real signal. Convention-driven names (`m_inner`, `getInstance`, `build`, `cache`, ...) remain excluded entirely.

Per-category combos shipped:

- `object_instantiation` — stdlib singletons (`make_unique`, `make_shared`, `std::make_unique`, `std::make_shared`, `allocate_shared`) plus the combo `["return", "new"]`. Bare `new` is rejected.
- `static_storage_access` — stdlib singletons (`call_once`, `std::call_once`, `once_flag`, `std::once_flag`).
- `self_return` — combo `["return", "*", "this"]` only.
- `interface_polymorphism` — combos `["virtual", "~"]`, `["virtual", "void"]`, `["virtual", "bool"]`, `["virtual", "int"]`, `["virtual", "std"]`, `["virtual", "auto"]`, `["override", "{"]`, `["override", ";"]`, `["override", "const"]`, `["final", "{"]`, `["=", "0"]` (pure-virtual marker). Bare `virtual` / `override` / `final` are rejected.
- `access_control_caching` — stdlib synchronization symbols (`std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::call_once`, ...). Presence anywhere in the class.
- `ownership_handle` — stdlib smart pointer symbols (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`). Presence anywhere in the class.
- `destruction_signal` — combo `["=", "delete"]` (the `= delete` declaration). Bare `delete` (a delete-expression) is rejected.

`delegation_forward` and `value_comparison` were considered and dropped: the only available evidence reduced to a single operator (`->` or `==`), which the dictionary discipline forbids. Patterns that previously leaned on `delegation_forward` (Adapter, Decorator wrapping, Proxy forwarding, Pimpl indirection) now rely on the matcher's `ordered_checks` plus their other signature categories — Adapter ends up with empty `signature_categories`, which means "ordered_checks alone".

**Survival** is binary. A pattern's match on a class survives the filter when ALL of its `signature_categories` are satisfied. There is no number attached — no score, no rank, no count. Surviving matches are equal candidates.

**Ambiguity.** When two or more matches survive on the same class, every survivor's `ambiguous` flag is set. The downstream AI doc service treats `ambiguous` as a signal to surface "this class fits multiple patterns" instead of pretending one won.

**Lexeme dictionary discipline.** The connotation dictionary at `Codebase/Microservice/pattern_catalog/lexeme_categories.json` MUST contain only:
1. C++ keywords (`static`, `virtual`, `override`, `final`, `delete`, `this`, ...).
2. C++ operators / punctuation (`->`, `==`, `~`, ...).
3. Symbols from well-known standard library APIs (`std::make_unique`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::call_once`, `std::shared_ptr`, ...).

Variable names, naming conventions, and project-specific identifiers (`m_inner`, `inner`, `wrapped`, `target`, `wrappee`, `delegate`, `impl`, `m_impl`, `cache`, `cached`, `getInstance`, `sharedInstance`, `build`, `create`, `make`, `finalize`, `instance`, ...) are intentionally excluded. Reading those as pattern signals is the failure mode this design replaces — they are user choices, not language facts. If a real pattern signal cannot be expressed in keywords / operators / stdlib symbols, it belongs in Round 2 as a structural predicate, not in the lexeme dictionary.

**Where it lives in the pipeline:** the candidate filter is module `Modules/{Header,Source}/Analysis/Patterns/Ranking/match_ranker.{hpp,cpp}`. It runs inside `run_pattern_dispatch_stage` after the existing dispatch passes, before tags are emitted. The directory is named `Ranking/` for path stability with prior commits, but the pass itself does no ranking — only filtering and an ambiguity flag. Each surviving `PatternMatchResult` gets `ambiguous` set; matches that fail the strict filter are dropped (this is the intended behavior — those are false positives the lexeme + grammar rule explicitly rejects).

**Why filtering is acceptable here:** the matcher's `ordered_checks` is conservative by design, but it cannot tell `return *this` apart from a stray `this` token, or `return new T()` apart from a local-variable initialization. The connotation rule is exactly the layer that rejects "right token, wrong grammatical position". When it rejects, the match was a false positive; dropping it is the correct outcome, not a loss of signal.

**Adding a new category** requires both (a) extending `lexeme_categories.json` with the lexeme list and (b) adding a per-category grammar predicate to `match_ranker.cpp`. A category without a grammar rule defaults to "presence anywhere in the class" — that is the fallback used for stdlib-symbol categories where presence already carries structural meaning.

**Adding a new pattern**: declare its `signature_categories` in the new pattern JSON. If a needed signal cannot be expressed via an existing category + grammar predicate, extend `lexeme_categories.json` and `match_ranker.cpp` together. Do NOT tighten `ordered_checks` to mimic ranking — `ordered_checks` is yes/no, ranking is comparative.

## D39 - Developer-only Step diagnostics with production no-leak enforcement
Step 1 -> Step 2 orchestration diagnostics are required for developer troubleshooting and GitHub Actions assertions, but must never appear in deployed user-facing responses or UI.

**Visibility gate**: `DEV_TEST_MODE` controls the internal profile.
- `DEV_TEST_MODE=true`: backend may expose internal diagnostics for local development and CI.
- `DEV_TEST_MODE=false` (production default): backend exposes only public, user-safe fields.

**Internal-only fields**:
- `step2JobId`
- phase-level Step 1/Step 2 transition timeline
- AI transport timing fields (`aiRequestSentAt`, `aiAckReceivedAt`, `aiFirstResponseAt`)
- CI-oriented failure buckets (`compile_failed`, `unit_failed`, `integration_failed`, `ai_send_failed`, `ai_timeout`)

**Production contract**:
- internal diagnostics are omitted from API responses
- internal debug endpoints are not mounted, forbidden, or not found
- production frontend does not render developer pipeline labels or transport diagnostics

**CI policy**:
- Strict checks run with `DEV_TEST_MODE=true` and are merge-blocking (compile, unit, integration, GDB, AI async contract)
- Same workflow includes a production-profile no-leak stage (`NODE_ENV=production`, `DEV_TEST_MODE=false`) that fails if internal diagnostics are visible

## D40 — Audience reframe drives all marketing copy and information architecture
The public-facing site is written for a specific reader profile, not for "developers" generically. The profile is a hard rule baked into copy, ordering, and feature prominence:

- **Touched C++ once in 1st year, forgot most of it.** Cannot be assumed to read uncommented code.
- **Ships working code via AI assistance.** Does not write C++ from scratch.
- **Does not know GoF design patterns by name** and has not seen the canonical UML.
- **Cannot be expected to memorize.** Every page must offload, never pile up.

**Implication on copy**: never use a pattern term, framework name, or compiler concept without an inline definition on first appearance. One new vocabulary item per paragraph maximum. Code samples 15 lines or fewer. Never dump a full class.

**Implication on positioning**: the hook is "your AI-written code passes deadline, will it pass review?" — not "learn design patterns." Patterns are the means; readability + auto-doc + auto-tests are the promised outcome.

**Implication on industry hooks**: the `/why` surface frames result-based stakes per industry (quant trading, low-level AI / inference engineering, embedded firmware, students). One short panel per industry, one stat or quote, no theory. This page exists so the reader self-identifies before being asked to learn anything technical.

This is an explicit reversal of the earlier `D31`-style "show the algorithm pipeline" landing. The pipeline still lives at `/mechanics`, but the landing surface is audience-first, not algorithm-first.

## D41 — Effects budget: one motion or interaction effect per page (hard rule)
The earlier marketing surface stacked aurora drift, shiny text sweep, magnetic cursor buttons, tilt cards, scroll-driven reveals, and split-text reveals on the same page. External fresh-eye review (Amiel, Jules) flagged this as visual overload, "too flashy," and "cannot read the upper-left animation in time."

**Rule**: each page picks **at most one** motion or interaction effect, deliberately chosen to support the page's job. Stacking is banned, including in subtle combinations. The effects library at `Codebase/Frontend/src/components/marketing/effects/` is preserved (it has internal value for studio surfaces and future opt-in use), but on public marketing pages the import budget per page is one.

**Concrete prohibitions on marketing pages** (Hero, Learn, About, Choose, Student Learning Hub, /why, /mechanics index, /patterns index, /tour, /research):
- No cursor-magnetic CTAs (`MagneticButton`'s magnetic transform is disabled on marketing surfaces; the component remains importable for API stability but no longer translates with cursor position).
- No spotlight / cursor-following highlight overlays.
- No tilt-on-hover cards.
- No animated multi-blob aurora background. A single static gradient panel is acceptable as visual identity; drifting blobs are not.
- No shiny-text sweep on headlines or paragraphs. A 9 s+ sweep on a single short non-essential element (e.g., a CTA word) is the only allowed shiny use, and only when it's the page's chosen one effect.
- No animation duration shorter than 300 ms on text or layout-affecting elements (the original 4.5 s upper-left sweep on a paragraph violated this in spirit by being unreadable in the time available).

`prefers-reduced-motion` continues to disable all remaining motion globally via `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` per D32. The new rule layers on top: even with motion enabled, each page's surface area has one effect, not five.

## D42 — Information offloading rule: one page = one job, minimal cross-reference
Reader profile per D40 cannot memorize. Pages are organized so that each page is readable in isolation and nothing depends on having read another page first.

**Rules**:
- Each public page has exactly one job stated in a single sentence in its doc blueprint. If a page has two jobs, split it.
- No "see also" sections, no "as we discussed in /mechanics…" cross-references, no breadcrumb chains that imply a reading order.
- Top-level navigation is the ONLY way pages refer to each other. The nav itself is the door; pages do not name other pages in body copy.
- When a concept needs context from another page to make sense, **inline a one-sentence stub** instead of linking. Duplication is cheaper than memorization.
- The Home page is surface-level only. Nothing on Home goes deeper than two sentences. Depth always lives on the target page.

**Implication on Home**: bento-style tile grid acts as silent doors. Each tile = one promise sentence + thumbnail. No tile teaches; tiles only invite.

**Implication on docs**: per-page doc blueprints under `docs/Codebase/Frontend/src/components/<surface>/<page>/...` start with a literal `## Sole job` line. Reviewers reject any page whose body covers more than that one job.

## D43 — Features-first hierarchy on landing (overrides earlier theory-first plans)
External review (Choco) flagged that the prior landing led with GoF pattern theory. This loses the audience defined in D40. The landing now leads with **what the app does for the user**, not pattern taxonomy.

**Top navigation lock** (4 items, no more, no less):
1. **Try it** — primary CTA. Lands on `/student-studio` (gated; auth happens here per D45).
2. **Features** — anchors to the Features grid on Home. Not a separate route. The grid lives on `/`.
3. **Learn** — `/learn`. Pattern theory and reference content live here, not on Home.
4. **About** — `/about`. Thesis rationale only.

Other surfaces (`/why`, `/mechanics`, `/patterns`, `/tour`, `/research`) exist but are not in the top navigation. They are reached via the Home bento grid or contextual links inside Features / Learn. This intentionally demotes pattern theory from a navigational peer of "what the app does."

**Features grid contract** (six tiles, in this order, on Home below the fold):
1. **Auto-documentation** — "Your code gets a README it didn't have, generated from the pattern we detected."
2. **Auto-integration tests** — "We write the tests your reviewer expects. You ship."
3. **Pattern detection** — "We tell you which design pattern your AI used — even when you didn't know."
4. **Readability score** — "See exactly which lines hurt the next reader. Fix them in one click."
5. **Sample library** — "Stuck? Load a real-world sample for any pattern. Learn by example."
6. **Run history** — "Every analysis saved. Compare versions. Track your readability over time."

Each tile: 1 verb-led title, 1 promise sentence, 1 thumbnail. Zero pattern names in this section. Pattern names appear when the user clicks into `/learn`.

**Above-the-fold contract on Home**:
1. Hook headline (one line).
2. Algorithm one-liner ("Powered by our own lexical-tagging + parse-tree algorithm. Fast. Efficient." — no depth on Home).
3. **30-second demo embed** (looped silent video with captions; placeholder accepted while real recording is pending).
4. **Three numbered steps** (1 paste, 2 we detect, 3 you ship docs + tests).
5. Single primary CTA → Try it.

## D44 — Testing Trophy is the test strategy (not unit-pyramid, not aspirational)
External recommendation (Alpha Romer, Symflower's Testing Trophy article) lands as the project's actual testing posture, not an inline badge. The Testing Trophy is a deliberate inversion of the unit-pyramid: heavy on integration tests, lighter on units, E2E for critical user flows, with static analysis as the bottom-stable layer.

**Layered budget** (target distribution; each layer is required to be non-empty before any release):
- **Static analysis** (broad base): TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, `clang-tidy`/`clang-format` on the C++ microservice, `cppcheck` if available.
- **Integration tests** (the meat): backend-route tests that spawn the real microservice binary against curated sample C++ files; pattern-catalog tests that load each catalog JSON and assert the matcher emits the expected signature on the catalog's own `samples/<pattern>/` files; AI-pipeline tests that stub the Claude HTTP client but exercise the real chunking / timeout / fallback logic per D37.
- **E2E** (critical-flow): Playwright runs covering "open studio → load sample → analyze → see pattern card → request docs → see fallback or AI doc." One spec per critical flow. Quarantine flaky specs immediately rather than retrying.
- **Unit tests** (small, surgical): only where the function has nontrivial branching that integration tests can't cheaply cover (e.g., the candidate-filter ambiguity logic per D38, the heuristic class-usage binder per D24).

**Stress harness (Sprint R)**: AI-generated random-C++ test cases drive the analyzer through edge cases (nested templates, multi-inheritance, anonymous namespaces, Lambdas, etc.). Output to `test-artifacts/stress/<run-date>/` with detection-rate, false-positive, false-negative, and crash counters. Failing seeds are promoted into the regression integration suite. The "incremental testing using the algorithm's `usages` graph" idea earlier discussed in chat is parked here: only revisited if random fuzzing + curated regressions don't catch enough.

**Doc location**: `docs/Research/testing-trophy.md` records this stance and links to the Symflower article as prior art. The harness scripts live under `tools/stress/` (not yet implemented).

## D45 — Studio first-run "Start here" rail removes the post-sign-in dead-end
External review (Jules) signed in successfully and did not know where to begin. The dead-end is not a content gap — it's a missing affordance. Studio surfaces (`/studio`, `/student-studio`, `/studio/analyze` once promoted) render a persistent first-run rail until the user has completed their first successful analysis.

**Rail contract**:
- Three numbered steps, each with the literal action wording the user must perform: ① "Load a sample" (button), ② "Click Analyze" (button reference), ③ "Read the result" (arrow pointing down).
- Anchored above the analysis form on first entry.
- Auto-collapses to a small "Start here" pill the moment a successful run lands. The pill stays for the rest of the session as a re-open affordance.
- Replayable from a `?` button in the studio header.
- Dismissibility: the user can dismiss the expanded rail with an explicit close button; dismissal sets `localStorage.nt_start_here_dismissed = '1'` and the rail does not re-expand on subsequent sessions. The `?` button still re-opens it on demand.

**State lives in `localStorage`, not in the auth store or DB**. Justification: it is a UI affordance per surface, not a per-account preference, and per D44 we do not introduce DB schema for ephemeral UI state. Key: `nt_start_here_dismissed` (boolean as `'1'` or absent). Compatible with multiple users on the same browser; each browser session decides for itself.

**Companion popup walkthrough** (`/tour` route + in-studio popups, planned): same content, two surfaces. The standalone `/tour` is public and auth-free for window-shopping; the in-studio popups are the same content gated to studio users. Both consume the same content source so they do not drift.

## D46 — Page naming locked: `/mechanics` for the algorithm deep-dive
The algorithm visualization page (per D31's pipeline) is locked to the route `/mechanics` and the navigational label "Mechanics." Alternates considered and rejected: `/anatomy` (medical-imagery fit was wrong for a code product), `/engine` (too generic, conflated with backend infra), `/pipeline` (too narrow — the page covers more than the pipeline diagram).

**Rationale**: "Mechanics" reads correctly to the audience profile in D40 — it implies "how the moving parts work," fits both a curious student and a pragmatic dev, and is one word per the user's explicit constraint.

The `/mechanics` page is **not** linked from the top navigation per D43. It is reached from the Home bento grid and from contextual links inside Features / Learn.

## D47 — Marketing pages route + open-by-default for learning surfaces
Per D40 + D43, the public learning surface must not gate on auth. Reading lessons, browsing pattern theory, and inspecting "correct structure" sections are all knowledge-acquisition flows that the audience cannot be asked to authenticate for.

**Rule**: any URL whose primary verb is "read", "learn", or "browse" stays public. Login is triggered only when the verb becomes "save", "run", "submit", or "configure".

**Implication on `StudentLearningHub`**: the previous session-gate panel that redirected to `/student-studio?next=/student-learning` is removed. The hub renders its lessons immediately for any visitor. The "Try this in the studio" sample-launch buttons inside the hub are the only points that may still trigger sign-in — and they do so by navigating to `/student-studio`, not by gating the surrounding lesson content.

**Implication on session-bound features inside the hub**: progress-tracking that previously assumed a logged-in session (`completedStepIds`, etc.) continues to work in-memory for the current browser tab. Nothing is persisted server-side for an unauthenticated visitor; if persistence is later needed, it cascades only when the visitor signs in to claim a seat.

## D48 — Triage-first sequencing: ship calmer ground before makeover
Per Amiel and Jules, the existing site has visual-overload and dead-end issues that make it hostile to fresh eyes. The full audience-first restructure (Sprints 0 through 12) is multi-week. Triage Sprints `−1a` (visual-overload kill: motion effects, hero size, spacing, alignment) and `−1b` (Studio Start-Here rail) ship first as a single coherent commit so the project is presentable while the larger restructure proceeds.

**Sprint `−1a` deliverables**:
- `MagneticButton` becomes a non-magnetic button (cursor transform removed; API surface preserved so callsites do not change).
- `AuroraBackground` reduces to a single static gradient (drift animations gone; component preserved).
- Hero `min-height: 100vh` becomes `clamp(480px, 70vh, 720px)`.
- `--nt-mkt-space-section` clamp halved.
- `EntryChoice` grid uses `grid-auto-rows: 1fr` and each card uses `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto` so the action button anchors to a uniform baseline across all cards (Tester / Developer / Student Learning / Admin).

**Sprint `−1b` deliverables**:
- `StartHereRail` component injected at top of `SubmitTab` for studio first-run.
- `localStorage.nt_start_here_dismissed` controls expanded vs collapsed.
- `?` button in studio header re-opens.

**Auth-gate fix** (companion to triage):
- `StudentLearningHub` session-gate removed per D47.

These ship as one commit because the visible-quality lift only lands when the user is no longer staring at competing motion AND can begin in the studio without assistance. Splitting them forces a half-improved interim state that does not reflect the project's intent.

## D49 — Top nav covers every public surface; top bar is non-sticky
The four-item top-nav lock from D43 is replaced by an expanded nav that surfaces every public page. Reasoning (per user direction): the audience cannot be expected to remember that some surfaces are reachable only from the Home bento grid — the nav must be the single canonical map of the site.

**New top-nav order** (eight links):
1. **Home** → `/`
2. **How it works** → `/mechanics`
3. **Why** → `/why`
4. **Patterns** → `/patterns`
5. **Tour** → `/tour`
6. **Research** → `/research`
7. **Learn** → `/learn`
8. **About** → `/about`

Plus the **Try it now** CTA on the right edge → `/student-studio`.

**Non-sticky behaviour**: the top bar is `position: relative` and scrolls away with the page. This was an explicit user request after the prior sticky bar covered too much screen real estate during reading.

**Mobile**: at ≤880 px viewport width the link list collapses behind a hamburger toggle (`☰ Menu`) and the Try-it CTA disappears (the same destination is reachable via the menu's hidden Home + bento path; users on mobile generally tap the menu anyway).

This supersedes D43's "four items, no more" rule on the nav specifically; the rest of D43 (features-first hierarchy, Features anchor on Home) stays in force.

## D50 — Spacing tightened: 15-20% air target on marketing surfaces
Per user direction after the prior triage-only commit: marketing pages still felt "spacy." The new rule: empty space caps at roughly 15-20% of the viewport unless a specific element earns more (a hero CTA, a single-quote callout, an in-progress demo embed).

**Concrete token changes**:
- `--nt-mkt-text-hero` clamped tighter: `clamp(2.2rem, 1rem + 4.2vw, 4.4rem)` (was `clamp(2.4rem, 1rem + 5vw, 5.2rem)`).
- `--nt-mkt-space-section` halved again: `clamp(1.4rem, 1rem + 2vw, 3rem)` (was `clamp(2rem, 1.5rem + 3vw, 4.5rem)`).
- Hero `min-height` clamped lower: `clamp(360px, 56vh, 600px)` (was `clamp(480px, 70vh, 720px)`).
- Per-surface page paddings on `/why`, `/mechanics`, `/patterns`, `/tour`, `/research`, `/about` reduced to `clamp(1.25rem, 1rem + 1.2vw, 2.5rem)` (was `clamp(2rem, 1.5rem + 2vw, 4rem)`).
- Demo embed aspect ratio changed to `21 / 9` (was `16 / 9`) so it occupies less vertical air.

The bento grid token set (`--nt-bento-*`) and per-component element paddings stay unchanged because they were already tight; the issue was the section-level air, not the component-level.

## D51 — Sample picker: GoF-split modal sourcing Nesteruk 2022
The single "Load sample" button drops one fixed sample. Per user direction it now opens a **modal picker** that lists every sample bundled under `Codebase/Microservice/samples/` grouped by family.

**Source of truth for pattern intents**: Nesteruk, D. (2022) *Design Patterns in Modern C++20*, Apress. The CodiNeo thesis cites this book as its design-pattern reference (Chapter 1.1, Chapter 2). One-line "intent" copy on each picker tile is paraphrased from Nesteruk's chapter on the corresponding pattern and explicitly cited in a footer line on the modal.

**Bundling**: `import.meta.glob('../../../../Microservice/samples/**/*.cpp', { eager: true, query: '?raw' })` so changing a `.cpp` file under `Codebase/Microservice/samples/` automatically updates the modal at next build. No backend change.

**Family mapping** (`META_BY_DIRECTORY` in `SamplePickerModal.tsx`):
- `builder/` → Creational · Builder
- `factory/` → Creational · Factory Method
- `singleton/` → Creational · Singleton
- `method_chaining/` → Behavioural · Method Chaining
- `strategy/` → Behavioural · Strategy
- `wrapping/` → Structural · Adapter / Proxy / Decorator
- `pimpl/` → Idioms · PIMPL
- `integration/`, `mixed/`, `negative/`, `usages/` → Idioms (utility)

**Fallback**: the legacy `fetchSample()` backend endpoint is kept as a single-file fallback when the bundled raw samples are empty (build-time error on Vite's glob, etc.). The studio is never stuck.

## D52 — In-studio popup tour uses react-joyride; same content as /tour
Per user direction (React Joyride reference): the in-studio walkthrough is implemented with `react-joyride` providing overlay + spotlight + beacon + tooltip. Content comes from `tourSteps.ts` so the public `/tour` page and the in-studio popup tour cannot drift — both render the same step array.

**Auto-trigger**: on first studio entry. `localStorage.nt_studio_tour_completed = '1'` blocks re-trigger after first completion.

**Replay**: a `? Tour` button in the studio header dispatches a `nt:studio-tour:open` event, AND a `nt:start-here:open` event so both the Joyride overlay AND the StartHereRail re-expand together.

**DOM targets** (Joyride `step.target`): the studio's existing IDs are the anchors:
- `#load-sample-btn` → step "Load a sample"
- `#analyze-btn` → step "Click Analyze"
- `#analysis-form` → step "Read the result"

Steps without a clean DOM target (`Sign in`, `Generate documentation`, `Save the run`, `Open run history`) render as centered modals via Joyride's `placement: 'center'`.

**Why react-joyride and not a hand-rolled overlay**: the spotlight / portal / focus-trapping behaviour is non-trivial to get right (z-index management, scroll-locking, screen-reader announcements, keyboard navigation). react-joyride is a maintained, well-known package; the cost of pulling it in is one dependency for a visibly polished tour.

**Bundle cost**: ≈ +25 KB gzipped main bundle. Acceptable given studio is auth-gated and not on the public marketing critical path.

## D53 — Playwright auto-screenshot capture for /tour
The public `/tour` page references `imagePath: '/tour/<slug>.png'` per step. The script `tools/capture-tour-screenshots.mjs` drives a real Chromium against the running studio and writes one PNG per step to `Codebase/Frontend/public/tour/`.

**Run**: `node tools/capture-tour-screenshots.mjs`

**Requirements**:
- Studio dev server on `http://localhost:3001` (override with `TOUR_BASE_URL`).
- Tester credentials in `NEOTERRITORY_TESTER_USER` / `NEOTERRITORY_TESTER_PASS` for auth-gated steps. Without them, the script captures the public-surface steps and skips the gated ones with a console warning rather than erroring.
- Playwright resolved from `Codebase/Frontend/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs` (same convention the existing `playwright-scratch/recorder.cjs` follows — single source of Playwright in the repo).

**Output**: `Codebase/Frontend/public/tour/<slug>.png`. After successful capture the script patches `tourSteps.ts` so `imagePath` points at the new files. The `/tour` page picks them up at next reload.

**Why a script and not a hook**: capture is a deliberate, supervised action — the studio must be in a known state, and re-running it accidentally during CI would write screenshots from a non-representative state. The script is invoked manually when the user wants to refresh the tour images.

## D54 — Joyride is tab-aware; sign-in step removed
External feedback (this turn): the previous in-studio Joyride tour was a single 8-step monolith that included a "Sign in" step the user had already cleared by the time they reached the studio. The tour also rendered the same 8 steps regardless of which studio tab the user was viewing.

**New behaviour**:
- Five distinct tab-scoped tours: `submit`, `annotated` (Patterns), `gdb` (Tests), `docs`, `ambiguous` (Self-check). Each is short — one to three steps — focused on what the current tab actually lets the user do.
- The "Sign in" step is gone. Joyride only mounts inside `MainLayout`, which only mounts after authentication, so the sign-in advisory was always redundant by the time it ran.
- Auto-trigger reads `localStorage.nt_studio_tour_completed__<tab>` so each tab tour fires once on its first visit and never again unless replayed.
- Replay button (`? Tour` in the studio header) re-runs the CURRENT tab's tour from step 1, not the global tour.
- Switching tabs cancels any running tour for the previous tab and starts (or skips, if already completed) the new tab's tour.

**Implementation**: `StudioJoyrideTour.tsx` reads `activeTab` from the app store; a `STEPS_BY_TAB` map provides the per-tab step set; the `<Joyride>` component is keyed by `tourTab` so React tears down and remounts when the tab changes (forces Joyride to reset its own internal step index).

**DOM targets** by tab:
- `submit`: `#load-sample-btn`, `#analyze-btn`, `#analysis-form`.
- `annotated`, `gdb`, `docs`, `ambiguous`: centered modals (no DOM target needed yet — content is informational rather than pointing).

This supersedes D52's "single tour from sign-in to history" model. The same `tourSteps.ts` content remains the source of truth for the public `/tour` page.

## D55 — Try-it chooser on Home: Learning vs. Studio
Per user direction (this turn): clicking "Try it now" on the Home page must not jump straight to the gated studio. The visitor first picks between two paths:

- **Learning module** → `/student-learning`. Open, no auth (per D47).
- **Studio app** → `/student-studio`. Auth required.

Sign-in is only triggered when the visitor picks Studio. This protects the audience profile from D40 (rusty-C++-via-AI users) from being blocked by an auth wall before they have any sense of what the product does.

**Implementation**: `TryItChooser.tsx` modal opened from both Home CTAs (above the fold and final). The modal is dismissable with Escape and backdrop click. No-op until the user picks a path, at which point it closes and navigates.

## D56 — /learn merged into /patterns
Per user direction (this turn): the lesson content previously housed on `/learn` (whatItIs / whenToUse / everydayExample / prerequisites / correctStructure) moves onto the per-pattern detail pages at `/patterns/<slug>`. `/patterns` becomes the single learning + reference surface; `/learn` is dropped from the top nav (route still resolves for back-compat with bookmarks).

**Why**: the audience cannot be expected to remember two separate learning surfaces. Pattern detail pages are the canonical "everything about this pattern" destination — including how to learn it.

**Schema impact**: `PatternEntry` in `patternData.ts` gains optional fields `oneLiner`, `whatItIs`, `whenToUse`, `everydayExample`, `prerequisites`, `correctStructure`, `nesterukChapter`. `PatternDetailPage.tsx` renders these as a "Learn it" section above Problem/Solution and a "Correct structure" section after Detection.

**Catalog expansion**: 7 additional patterns from Nesteruk 2022 added to `patternData.ts` — Observer, Iterator, Command, Composite, Template Method, State, Repository (the last is from the CodiNeo thesis Chapter 1.1 list of patterns DEVCON Luzon learners are expected to recognise; Nesteruk covers it under "patterns in modern application architectures"). PIMPL is also promoted from "samples-only" to a full reference entry.

## D57 — Research bibliography reflects the actual thesis paper
Per user direction (this turn): the research bibliography must use the actual CodiNeo thesis at `FINAL THESIS 3 PAPER.pdf` (root) as its anchor, with citations consistent with the thesis bibliography.

**Primary book**: Nesteruk, D. (2022) *Design Patterns in Modern C++20*, Apress. The thesis cites this in Chapter 1.1 + 2 as the design-pattern reference. The Refactoring.Guru entry from Sprint 10 is removed — it was a guess made before the thesis PDF was inspected; Nesteruk 2022 is what the paper actually cites.

**Thesis paper itself**: `docs/Research/codineo-thesis.md` — the authors, school, year, adviser, panel, and a summary of which design decisions in this `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` correspond to which thesis chapter.

**Thesis-cited papers** added: Romeo et al. (2024), Rukmono et al. (2021), Park et al. (2021), Nguyen Quang Do et al. (2020), Hou et al. (2024). Each entry's "Why it matters for this thesis" section names the thesis chapter that cites it.

## D58 — Studio topbar simplified to plain sticky-top
Per user direction (this turn): the studio topbar should be a "normal div sa taas ng mga component" but "ayaw kong nasama sya sa scrolling" — translated, a plain sticky-top block, not a floating overlay with backdrop blur and self-scroll fallback.

**Removed**: the previous `max-height: calc(100vh - 24px); overflow: auto` self-scroll trick (which created a nested scrollbar inside the topbar when the page got tall) and the `backdrop-filter: blur(18px)` glass effect.

**Kept**: `position: sticky; top: 0;` so the topbar pins to the top of the studio while content scrolls beneath it.

Net effect: the topbar reads as a regular block at the top of the studio that happens to stay pinned; no special-overlay styling.

## D59 — `/patterns` is unified; no All/GoF filter
Per user direction (this turn): the previous All/GoF filter on `/patterns` and the `/patterns/gof` route variant are removed. The focus IS GoF, so distinguishing "All" from "GoF" in the UI was misleading. The page is now a single unified directory grouped by family.

**Catalog scope**: Method Chaining, Repository, and PIMPL are kept in the catalog even though they are not strictly GoF — they are first-class members of OUR detection catalog per the CodiNeo thesis Chapter 1.1 + 1.7 (where Repository is named as a supported pattern) and Chapter on Idioms (where PIMPL belongs).

**Route alias**: `/patterns/gof` still resolves (it routes to the unified index) so old links do not 404.

**Schema impact**: the `isGoF` field briefly added in an earlier draft of this turn is gone — there is no UI that distinguishes GoF vs non-GoF, so the field would be dead data.

## D60 — Home demo: inline SVG flow, no external file
Per user direction (this turn): the previous Home demo slot referenced `/demo/landing-30s.webm` and `/demo/landing-30s.jpg`, neither of which existed. The result was a blank rectangle directly under the hero headline. Replaced with an inline SVG flow diagram showing the three-step pipeline (paste C++ → detect pattern → docs + tests).

**Why SVG and not a captured PNG**: the diagram is conceptual (each "step" is illustrative), not a screenshot. SVG keeps it crisp at any size, ships zero asset weight, and lives next to the page that uses it. A real demo recording can replace the SVG later as a `<video>` slot; the SVG stays as the prefers-reduced-motion fallback.

## D61 — `/mechanics`: ASCII pre-blocks replaced with inline SVG diagrams
Per user direction (this turn): the five algorithm stages on `/mechanics` previously rendered as `<pre>` ASCII art. Replaced with inline SVG diagrams that render crisply on any viewport. Each diagram uses a shared palette (`COLOR_BG / PANEL / BORDER / ACCENT / LIME / PURPLE`) and the same `<StageSvg>` wrapper so the five diagrams share a single visual language.

**Why SVG and not a Playwright-captured PNG**: the diagrams are illustrative explanations of the algorithm, not screenshots of running software. Their meaning is fixed by the algorithm description (D31), not by any UI state. SVG keeps them text-versionable, easy to edit per future D-decision, and crisp on every viewport.

**Where Playwright IS used for `/mechanics` pictures**: the marketing-screenshot script (`tools/capture-marketing-screenshots.mjs`, D62) captures the rendered `/mechanics` page (i.e., the SVGs in context with the prose) to `public/preview/mechanics.png` for press-kit use.

## D62 — Marketing-surface Playwright capture: no Docker needed
Per user direction: use Playwright for pictures wherever possible. The full studio capture script (`tools/capture-tour-screenshots.mjs`, D53) needs Docker and auth credentials. To capture the PUBLIC marketing surfaces without that overhead, this turn adds `tools/capture-marketing-screenshots.mjs`.

**How it works**:
1. Spawns `npx vite preview` from `Codebase/Frontend/` so the built `dist/` is served at `http://127.0.0.1:4173` (override with `VITE_PREVIEW_PORT`).
2. Waits for the preview server to answer.
3. Drives Chromium (resolved from `Codebase/Frontend/node_modules/playwright`) to each public route at 1440x900 with `deviceScaleFactor: 2`.
4. Writes one PNG per surface to `Codebase/Frontend/public/preview/`.
5. Tears down the preview server.

**Surfaces captured** (one PNG each):
- `home.png`, `mechanics.png`, `why.png`, `patterns.png`, `patterns-singleton.png`, `tour.png`, `research.png`, `about.png`.

**Why dist/ and not dev server**: dev mode emits HMR overlays and dev banners that should not appear in press-kit shots. The built `dist/` matches what production serves.

**Run**: `npx vite build && node tools/capture-marketing-screenshots.mjs`. The captures land under `Codebase/Frontend/public/preview/` so they can be referenced from doc files or external press materials. They are not auto-displayed inside the marketing pages — those use the inline SVGs per D60 + D61 instead.

## D63 — CI requirement-coverage audit 2026-05-11 (baseline)

Per user direction this turn: audit whether the CI/CD test suite actually verifies the project's stated requirements (D21 locked catalog, D38 ambiguity, D44 Testing Trophy, D68 sample gate) or has drifted into a smoke test that just confirms the page renders. The goal was explicitly **not** to make CI green — it was to bring CI's gates into compliance with the documented requirements and let real product gaps surface.

**Why this audit happened**: the `#status-title` element was removed by the layout-flatten refactor (D58 trail / commit `2a51db4`). CI stayed green for months because the spec's selector was already so weak that "tree renders" was the only assertion. The removal eventually broke the selector outright and the cascade exhausted `/auth/claim`, which finally got attention. The real fault wasn't the refactor — it was that no assertion ever looked at WHAT the detector emitted, only whether the DOM responded.

### What changed (commits `588f645` → `0ca3f5c`, plus `840bc5e`, `6beb120`)

- **Phase A — Selector hardening + crash-safe seat lifecycle.** Added `data-testid` on `status-title`, `status-detail`, `tab-<id>`, `analyze-btn`, `load-sample-btn`, `class-tree-view` (with `data-empty`), `class-tree-name`, `class-tree-badge` (with `data-pattern`), `gdb-phase-row` (with the previously-missing `data-phase` + `data-verdict`), and `run-all-tests-btn`. `all-samples.spec.ts` and the `StudioPage` POM use `getByTestId`. A new `playwright/global-teardown.ts` reads `.playwright-seat.json` and posts `/auth/disconnect` even when a Playwright worker crash skips `test.afterAll` — the exact cascade that masked the previous CI failure.
- **Phase B — Sample coverage (D21 regression contract).** SAMPLES grew from 10 to 15. Added: `integration/all_patterns.cpp`, `negative/plain_class_no_pattern.cpp`, `negative/plain_widget.cpp`, `usages/usages_adapter_trace.cpp`, `usages/usages_smart_pointers.cpp`. SampleSpec gained a `kind` discriminator (`positive | negative | integration`) and the negative-sample test branch enforces the false-positive contract (no locked-catalog pattern may surface).
- **Phase C — Structural assertions (D68).** Added `expectedPatternNameRegex` per positive sample and `expectedAllCatalogPatterns` on the integration sample. The new assertion auto-resolves ambiguous classes (mirroring how a real user reaches the test-runner) then scans every rendered badge's `data-pattern` attribute. A regression that silently swaps Singleton→Factory now fails CI.
- **Phase D — Missing test layers (D44).** Wired `vitest` into the backend. Extracted `findAmbiguousClasses` + `filterToTaggedPatterns` from `routes/analysis.ts` into `services/candidateFilter.ts` so they're testable in isolation. New unit tests: `candidateFilter.test.ts` (10 cases covering D38) and `aiDocumentationService.test.ts` (8 cases on the AI envelope per D44). Added `npm --prefix Codebase/Backend run test:unit` to CI between typecheck and build. Extended `scripts/ci-gdb-runner-flow.mjs` so the gdb-runner job (a) asserts the analyze response actually detects singleton (not just that `pendingId` exists), (b) asserts the `static_analysis` phase has `verdict !== 'sandbox_disabled'`. The cppcheck-`-`-stdin bug from `6beb120` would have lit this canary up before AWS shipped.
- **Phase E — AWS post-deploy verification.** New `post-deploy-smoke` job in `ci.yml`, main-branch only, runs after `deploy-aws`. Hits the LIVE deployment at `AWS_PUBLIC_URL` (repo Actions variable), claims a tester seat, posts a Singleton snippet, runs the test pipeline, asserts compile_run=pass and static_analysis verdict ≠ sandbox_disabled. Production drift gets caught here, not in user reports. First green run: `25673446550` (commit `26a2ff1`).
- **Phase F — Monitored re-run + audit.** Three CI runs total. Run #1 (commit `80a68ac`) failed 7/16; failures were test-author bugs (`isVisible` race, missing data-empty handling for negative samples, studio-screenshots clicking a locked tab). Run #2 fixed those and the negative-sample contract: 11/15 pass. Run #3 added ambiguity auto-resolution before the structural check: **12/15 pass**.

### CI green vs. detector-gap evidence

CI runs to consult: ci.yml `25673446550` (all 10 jobs green, including new `post-deploy-smoke`), playwright-e2e `25674123004` (12/15 samples pass).

The **3 still-failing samples** are the audit's primary output — real detector gaps the previous CI never reported:

| Sample | Label | Detector emits | Why this matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query_predicate.cpp` | Method Chaining | `Builder` | The matcher confuses fluent `*this` returns with the Builder pattern. Builder's `build()` terminator should be the negative signal that disqualifies a pure method-chaining class; that signal is either missing or not strong enough in the candidate filter. |
| `logging_proxy.cpp` | Wrapping (Proxy/Decorator family) | `Adapter` | Adapter is structurally similar (wraps another type) but semantically distinct (translates an interface; doesn't add behaviour transparently). The catalog needs a stronger discriminator between Adapter and Proxy/Decorator, or the sample needs to lean harder on the proxy idiom so the matcher's existing signals fire. |
| `integration/all_patterns.cpp` | All locked-catalog patterns | Surfaces Adapter, Singleton, Builder ×2, Factory, Strategy ×3 — **never `method_chain`** | The integration regression contract says every D21 catalog entry must surface at least once. Method Chaining never does, consistent with the query_predicate finding above. This is the contract the test was designed to enforce. |

These are not test bugs. The spec is reading the actual `data-pattern` attribute that the studio renders to a user after ambiguity resolution. If the team disagrees about whether `query_predicate.cpp` IS a Builder, the right answer is to update the sample's `kind` / `expectedPatternNameRegex`, NOT to weaken the assertion.

### Algorithm-known-limits gate (per-user direction this turn)

User direction in the same turn this audit was produced: *"If detector gaps talaga sya wag pipilitin hayaan or have the tester to handle sa limits ng algorithm namin."* — accept the algorithm's real limits, don't make CI red over things the catalog isn't yet built to detect.

Implemented via `algorithmKnownLimits` on each SampleSpec:

```ts
algorithmKnownLimits?: {
  acceptedAlternatePattern?: RegExp;   // positive samples
  missingFromCatalogScan?: RegExp[];   // integration sample
  reason: string;                       // documented justification
}
```

Effect:
- **`query_predicate.cpp`** — `acceptedAlternatePattern: /builder/i`. Builder is now a documented-alternate pass for this file.
- **`logging_proxy.cpp`** — `acceptedAlternatePattern: /adapter/i`. Adapter is a documented-alternate pass.
- **`integration/all_patterns.cpp`** — `missingFromCatalogScan: [/method.?chain/i]`. The method-chain presence check is skipped on this sample (consistent with the query_predicate finding).

When the documented-limit path fires, the test records a `testInfo.annotation` of type `algorithm-known-limit` with the reason verbatim. CI passes; the gap stays visible in the Actions report under each test's annotations; nobody pretends the catalog detects what it doesn't.

The list is meant to shrink as the catalog learns. When a future commit adds the missing discriminators (Builder-vs-method_chain terminator, Proxy/Decorator-vs-Adapter signature), the entry comes off, and any regression there fails CI.

### Final CI state

After applying `algorithmKnownLimits`: all 15 samples pass with three annotated as `algorithm-known-limit`. Run `gh run list --workflow=playwright-e2e.yml --limit 1` for the most recent run; open each test's annotations to see the documented gaps.

### What this audit fixed about the audit process itself

1. **Selector fragility hotspots** that allowed silent drift are now `data-testid`-anchored. A future layout refactor of the same kind as `2a51db4` will not break tests without surfacing a real regression.
2. **Seat-pool lifecycle** survives worker crashes via `.playwright-seat.json` + `globalTeardown`. The `/auth/claim` cascade from the previous failing run cannot happen again.
3. **Phase coverage** — Testing Trophy base, integration, E2E, and AWS production are all gated now. Per D44 each layer now has at least one assertion that maps to a documented requirement.
4. **AWS drift visible in CI** — pre-Phase E, the deploy job had zero post-deploy assertions and bugs like cppcheck-stdin only got discovered when a user noticed `static_analysis` stuck on `idle`. The new `post-deploy-smoke` job catches the same class of bug in CI.

### Out of scope (deliberate, follow-ups)

- **`studio-screenshots.spec.ts`** is excluded from the playwright-e2e gate. It captures thesis figures and asserts nothing about correctness; running it as a gate is noise. Capture manually via `npx playwright test playwright/tests/studio-screenshots.spec.ts`.
- **Class-usage binder tests (D24)** — the binder lives in `services/classUsageBinder.ts`; unit-testing it in isolation requires fixture-driving microservice output. Deferred — D44 coverage is partial here.
- **`Codebase/Frontend/app.js`** still references `#status-title` as dead code from the pre-React era. Cleanup belongs in a separate refactor.

### Next steps (if the project wants the 3 red samples green)

These are product changes, not test changes:
- Add a `method_chain` negative signal to the Builder catalog entry (or a positive Builder signal that requires a `build()`-like terminator).
- Strengthen the Proxy/Decorator signature in the structural catalog so `logging_proxy.cpp` doesn't fall to Adapter.
- Audit `integration/all_patterns.cpp` to make sure its method-chaining class is distinctly recognisable as such (e.g. lacks a Builder terminator).

The test contract is the spec; the catalog is what needs to learn.

## D78 (this turn) — Auth surface consolidation

Retired surfaces:
- `/choose` page (EntryChoice) — DELETED
- `/login` and `/seat-selection` tester-pick surfaces (LoginOverlay) — DELETED

New single auth entry: the `TryItChooser` popup mounted by `MarketingShell` on every marketing route. Three cards (Tester Guest, Student Learning, Developer). Admin is reachable only via direct `/app`; never linked from the popup.

Flow changes:
- Tester (Guest) opens the extracted `SeatClaimPanel` inline (no nav) and `claimSeat()` runs in-place. Popup closes and routes to `/studio` on success.
- "Back to choices" inside the popup rewinds an internal view, never page navigation.
- `useAuth.signOut()` now always navigates to `/` (was bouncing to `/choose`).
- `ConsentGate` decline reuses `signOut()`; same end-state.
- `StudioApp` unauthenticated visitor → `navigate('/')` + `dispatchTryItChooserOpen()` instead of `replaceState('/choose')`.
- `/choose`, `/login`, `/seat-selection` now map to the new `notFound` surface (`NotFoundPage.tsx`) so stale bookmarks land somewhere honest.

### D78b — Test-runner tagging gate + backend ambiguity guard

User report: incognito session on the Tests tab showed `(none) / No patterns to test / 1. Static analysis (cppcheck) — idle / 2. Code compiles & runs — no template / 3. Unit-test verdict — no template` even after tagging classes on the Patterns tab. Root cause: the backend `routes/analysis.ts` `handleRunTests` path emitted a synthetic `TestResult` row when `taggedPatterns` filtered to zero, which the studio rendered as a real verdict. The studio also did not gate `Run all tests` on tag completeness.

Fixes:
- Frontend (`GdbRunnerTab.tsx`): derived `taggingComplete = taggedClassCount > 0 && localAmbiguous.length === 0`; `canRun` requires `taggingComplete`; empty-state copy distinguishes the three cases (no analysis / no tags / unresolved ambiguity). `visibleGroups` filters any synthetic `(none)` group as defense in depth.
- Backend (`routes/analysis.ts`): the synthetic-no-patterns emission is gone. New 400 `AMBIGUOUS_TAGS` response when (a) `resolvedMap` contains placeholder pattern ids (`""`, `(none)`, `none`), or (b) `taggedPatterns` filters to zero className-bound entries. The legacy 409 ambiguity check is unchanged.

### D78c — Student Learning accordion default

`openSectionId` falls back to `'intro'` when there is no persisted open section AND the user has not started a step. The previous `sectionForStepIndex(0)` path returns `'intro'` for index 0 in practice, but the explicit fallback removes any ambiguity for fresh incognito sessions.
