# Dockerfile

- Source: Infrastructure/session-orchestration/docker/Dockerfile
- Kind: Container build definition

## Story
### What Happens Here

This file implements the container build recipe for NeoTerritory session execution. It defines the image composition that later gets built and deployed by the bootstrap scripts.

### Why It Matters In The Flow

Runs before the C++ executable when the environment, runtime folders, container image, or Kubernetes assets need to be prepared.

### What To Watch While Reading

Builds the container image used for per-user NeoTerritory sessions. It collaborates directly with ubuntu:24.04 and . /app.
